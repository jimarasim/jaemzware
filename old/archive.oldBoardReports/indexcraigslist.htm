<span>$79900 2.5 ac, power, well, GATED, Near beach, views, JUST IN: Modulars OK! (1 mile from beach and Elwha River!)</span><br />
<span>NOTICE: Due to homebuilders being so busy, we have had lots of folks asking if modular homes are allowed. We spoke with the owner of lot #2 and he is willing to change the CC+R's to allow nice looking triple wides or modular AS LONG AS THEY ARE NOT UGLY DOUBLE WIDE TYPES. He is a heck of a nice guy and had no obligation to do this, so if you really want a home fast and easy, come see us, we can make modular happen.

WHY BUY LAND WEST OF PORT ANGELES? WHY NOT SEQUIM?
People that know the Olympic Peninsula tend to settle west of Port Angeles for a number of reasons.
1) Wells are pure, no chemicals, farm or industry runoff
2) Good drainage- gravelly and sandy soils make for inexpensive trouble free septic systems
3) Environmental issues- None of those on our lots. No wetlands, Quack Grass, creeks, flooding, poor soils, etc.
4) No crowding, noise pollution, low crime (NONE in our area in the 37 years we have lived next door to these lots). Once you cross the Elwha River, it is like you just escaped the rat race!
5) We are only 8 miles from town. 12 minutes. NO traffic jams!
6) We are closer to all your outdoor recreation areas. 1 mile to the public beach! Listen to the waves crash on the beach at night!

We had 4 lots for sale. 2.5 acres each (more or less)

Lot #2 is sold and a beautiful new Este's home was just finished!

We have 3 lots left,
Approx 2.5 ac. each.
Secured with a custom built wrought iron gate with paved entry. Gate is equipped with a powered opener. Conduit and sensors are in place underground to facilitate automating the gate from your home!.

The private entry road gently winds easterly past lot #1, #2 (sold) #3 and stops at lot #4. Each lot has it's own private driveway and cleared home site at the north end of each lot for maximum separation from the 4 neighbors 600-700 feet to the south.

Situating the home sites at the north end of the lots also gives you maximum sunlight during winter's shorter days.
We recently strategically thinned the timber</span><br />

<span>$60000 / 110000ft2 - Land / building lot 2.53 acres (Mason County)</span><br />
<span>Overlooking Oakland Bay in the Bayshore area off Hwy 3, the lot is high above the road. This is an older short plat with a proper driveway, power and phone are in. It was perked in 1997 when the short plat was completed. The lot I have for sale (lot #4 on the attached plat map) is a fairly flat lot with a wonderful Southern exposure. In an area of large parcels and commercial timberland. It is 2.53 acres. Territorial views and a nice view of Oakland Bay.
This is an area that does not allow manufactured housing so a better neighborhood with better values. Zoning allows for a home of any size and an accessory dwelling unit (ADU/mother in law) of up to 1000 square feet.
There is a public salt water fishing just down the street, close to Shelton and services.
$60,000 cash or 25% down on a 10 year note between 7% and 9% depending on credit score. Willing to discuss alternate terms depending on buyers needs. Payment would be around $500/mo.

Please serious inquiries only and no offers to help with the sale. </span><br />

<span>$79900 2.5 ac, power, well, GATED, Near beach, views, JUST IN: Modulars OK! (1 mile from beach and Elwha River!)</span><br />
<span>NOTICE: Due to homebuilders being so busy, we have had lots of folks asking if modular homes are allowed. We spoke with the owner of lot #2 and he is willing to change the CC+R's to allow nice looking triple wides or modular AS LONG AS THEY ARE NOT UGLY DOUBLE WIDE TYPES. He is a heck of a nice guy and had no obligation to do this, so if you really want a home fast and easy, come see us, we can make modular happen.

WHY BUY LAND WEST OF PORT ANGELES? WHY NOT SEQUIM?
People that know the Olympic Peninsula tend to settle west of Port Angeles for a number of reasons.
1) Wells are pure, no chemicals, farm or industry runoff
2) Good drainage- gravelly and sandy soils make for inexpensive trouble free septic systems
3) Environmental issues- None of those on our lots. No wetlands, Quack Grass, creeks, flooding, poor soils, etc.
4) No crowding, noise pollution, low crime (NONE in our area in the 37 years we have lived next door to these lots). Once you cross the Elwha River, it is like you just escaped the rat race!
5) We are only 8 miles from town. 12 minutes. NO traffic jams!
6) We are closer to all your outdoor recreation areas. 1 mile to the public beach! Listen to the waves crash on the beach at night!

We had 4 lots for sale. 2.5 acres each (more or less)

Lot #2 is sold and a beautiful new Este's home was just finished!

We have 3 lots left,
Approx 2.5 ac. each.
Secured with a custom built wrought iron gate with paved entry. Gate is equipped with a powered opener. Conduit and sensors are in place underground to facilitate automating the gate from your home!.

The private entry road gently winds easterly past lot #1, #2 (sold) #3 and stops at lot #4. Each lot has it's own private driveway and cleared home site at the north end of each lot for maximum separation from the 4 neighbors 600-700 feet to the south.

Situating the home sites at the north end of the lots also gives you maximum sunlight during winter's shorter days.
We recently strategically thinned the timber</span><br />

<span>UPDATE 8/25: PENDING SALE

This condo is a rare fully owner-titled condo. NOT A TIME SHARE. No contracts. Cash-out only.

This is an older Association and is under older, less stringent, Bylaws. These units may be rented out nightly or long-term. Each owner has control over their units as long as the ByLaws and Rules are followed. Most units are rented long-term. Some are kept for owner vacation homes. Dues are kept reasonable and the Association is run by a Board of owners. Some owners have a local property manager, some handle their own, the rest never rent their units. At least a third of the owners have owned for several years, some since the beginning (over 30 years!).

Very well maintained older 2-bedroom on ground floor. Perfect for limited mobility with no steps, large bathroom, and well-designed open space. Lots of big windows. Walking distance to almost everything Ocean Shores has to offer. Located on a block-long street very near mini golf and Convention Center. No traffic and only one street off main beach access.

Current HOA dues $214.33, water and trash included. Rentable for $650 - $700/mo. or live in. Great location, three buildings with only 15 total units, one of which is a common unit, and a common laundry room.

Very nicely furnished. Price includes all furnishings, including cookware, bedding, dishes, etc. Turn-key ready for immediate occupancy upon closing. Two nice sized bedrooms with one queen in master and two twins in second. Full sized closets, each with built-in lockable storage. Also has LazyBoy sofa bed in living room. Sleeps 6 comfortably with ample room.

Clear title with no assessments or liens.

You have a great opportunity to own waterfront properties with wonderful views east & SE across the waters of the Puget Sound to Seattle and Cascade Mountains. These double side-by-sides properties are amazing. Buyer will need a hydro/geologist engineer to clarify building potential. The road at the lot there is a nearly sheer drop off down to the beach. Be extremely careful viewing and do not stand on the edge of the lot. These waterfront lots need a creative person to solve the challenges.

<span>$29950 Enjoy off grid living! (Vashon Island)</span><br />
<span>I will NOT respond to inquiries unless you provide a name and verifiable phone number. Too many fakes out there...

Are you looking for the perfect spot to build your off grid, sustainable home? Do you love the peace and quiet of island living, yet close to town? Then we may have the perfect lot for your dream home. This property is about ten minutes from the North Vashon ferry dock, and about ten minutes from downtown Vashon. We think that a second story roof top deck would enjoy some views of the Olympics, Puget Sound, and the Cascades.

We are now offering our fairly level, shy one acre, pristine heavily forested lot for sale. We envision possibly using the trees on the lot to build the ultimate sustainable home. With the use of potable water catchment systems, tier three greywater reuse systems, composting/incinerating toilets, wind/solar power and sustainable products for construction, this would be the ultimate green home (property does have power)! Ten years ago, we had the property perked. So a small drain field could be installed for the tier 3 requirements. All information needs to be verified by the buyer.

We have experts in this type of home that we could pass onto you for your feasibility study, at your expense.

For more information, please contact us via CL email. We are open to cash offers for this property.

Thanks for looking! </span><br />

<span>$58000 / 3br - Waterfront floating "condo" - quality living for under $60K! (Ballard)</span><br />
<span>Tired of long commutes or paying crazy high rent to get decent housing close in? Takes some out-of-the-box thinking but here's an affordable, super-quality-of-life option. The Misty Cove is a floating home, a vintage 53' Pacemaker yacht with three floors of spacious living! In real estate terms, she's got 3 bedrooms and 3 baths, a sunroom with a fireplace, a galley/kitchen with bar seating, living and dining areas and for the best views of all, what we affectionately call the "sky lounge". She's been our full-time home for the past 6 years, moored at beautiful Shilshole Bay Marina in Ballard.

Vintage means old. She was built in 1968 with a wooden hull, which translates into many things:

-Wooden boats are quieter than fiberglass hulls.
-Wooden boats are heavier and not as affected by wave action.
-Wooden boats have more character.
-Wooden boats require more maintenance.
-Wooden boats, as a rule, can't be financed through a bank.

The Misty Cove is a work in progress, and the progress has been seriously derailed by health issues. She's very "live-able", but she could be even better! We need to sell her as-is and pass on the joy and the challenge, the fun and the work of bringing her back to her former glory. Shilshole is a great close-in base for those who work in the city but she's a boat! Move her to whatever location works for you - She has twin Detroit diesel engines that purr. Shilshole moorage is $1107/mo.

Dock life is amazing and living onboard is waterfront living at its finest. Take a look at the photos and if you love living with nature, love adventure and love marching to a different drummer, come take a look. Sale includes all furnishings.

<span>$17900 / 1br - 300ft2 - RV Resort Lot with 37' Alpha Gold 5th Wheel (PSCC)</span><br />
<span>Camping Club lot at # 818 Dogwood and 37 foot Alpha Gold Fifth Wheel at Port Susan Camping Club in Tulalip near Marysville, WA. Has large wood storage shed that is insulated and wired with attic and a large wood gazebo as well. Comes furnished. Lot is large so has plenty of parking for boat or multiple cars. Lot is in timber so is shaded, but still gets plenty of sunshine. Deck is 8'x12'. RV is in excellent shape for its age and has a new water heater and roof coating. Lot is close to resort amenities like lake and clubs.

Port Susan Camping Club is located at 12015 Marine Dr in Tulalip. Initial membership fee is $1000 and the yearly dues are $950 going up to $1000 next year. That means your monthly club expenses are less than $100/month. That might be less than you pay to store your RV uncovered at a Self-Storage place. You can store your RV here year round for less than $100/month, plus enjoy all the membership benefits and amenities of the park. Amenities include private fishing/recreation lake, family center with full size swimming pool, adult center, senior center w/hot tub and pool, internet center, cafe, laundromat, fitness center with full size pool, mail center, chapel, sports field and covered picnic area, and a salt-water beach on Puget Sound. Also has storage lots for additional RV's/storage trailers for $250 a year. You are limited to 180 days/year on site for each membership site you have, so if you want to stay year round you would need to have a 2nd membership. Many people stay year round. No limit on the number of days you can keep your RV on site. You have 12 month access by use of passes. Secure gated community. Rangers patrol by all membership sites several times/day. Live here inexpensively and save money for travel, entertainment, a new home, grand kids, etc.

Price to sell at $17,900 cash. The few remaining lots at PSCC that have RV's are either not comparable due to small lot size, small shed, or quality of RV or are $25,000-$55,000.

<span>$15000 Beachfront Property Near Moclips, WA - Rare Opportunity! (Moclips, WA)</span><br />

Dimensions are 50x235ft, a quarter acre. Grays Harbor Parcel Number 211232410030. Beach access requires a permit from the Quniault Indian Tribe.

<span>$69500 / 1br - 400ft2 - Recreational property in Packwood (Packwood)</span><br />
<span>For Sale,
Great Recreational Property in the resort town of Packwood, WA with a newer 400 sq ft Park Model Trailer. Excellent place for summer time fun and winter skiing because you are only 25 mins from White Pass Ski Resort. This home has 1 bedroom, a set of bunk beds, and a hide a bed in living room so it sleeps 6 comfortably. There are also 2 large covered areas providing cover from the rain and heat so you can still do outdoor cooking, seating, socializing and just generally lounging around. There is a large fire pit for many endless nights of s'mores. There is a large storage shed and 2 RV hook ups. And last we have an outdoor bathroom with a operational toilet and sink but still needs insulation and Sheetrock to finish up. The lot size is about a 1/3 of an acre and there is still plenty of room left over for lots of tents and travel trailers for those family camping weekends. Our kids are all grown up and no longer care to spend weekends there, so we do not find our selves using it much any more. One more thing to mention is The Packwood Days on Memorial Day and a Labor Day they are fun, exciting and memorable way to spend many holiday weekends. So start your new memories today.
Purchase Price for this unique property is $69,500.00
We will not carry a contract

<span>$65000 / 2100ft2 - Rental investment commercial building current renter long term (Pe Ell WA)</span><br />
<span>Good rental investment on a very visible corner on highway to beaches. It is currently rented to solid long term tenants. They have a small food manufacturing company. They have put lots of time and money into the remodel of the commercial kitchen and would like to stay on. The brick building is aprox. 2100 square feet (24x90) The lot is 25x120. It has a commercial kitchen 2 restrooms 2 large breaker boxes and lots of retail floor space. There is also a small yard out back.
The city will allow it to be used as a residence or a business or both. The way the restrooms are arranged it would be easy for an apartment to be made in the back portion of the building. That would almost double the rental income.

Give me a call and I can answer your questions and tell you more about the building. $68,000 or 65,000 for cash. </span><br />

<span>$39000 / 2br - 1240ft2 - Fixer mobile home on 0.93 acres (Pe ell)</span><br />
<span>1973 double wide on 0.93 acres.
Address is 4212 state route 6 Chehalis.
Parcel # 020050001000
The property is about 18 miles west of Chehalis.
The trailer needs a lot of work, the living room, kitchen, and bathroom need to be redone from floor to ceiling.
The 2 bedrooms are in OK condition.
The 2 added on rooms onto the back of the home needs to be redone.
The roof over the trailer, addition, and deck leaks.
Currently there is no power because PUD removed the meter due to it not being used.
The current power pole needs to be replaced, I have a bid for 2800 to put in a new pole, meter box and run power to the breaker.
Well house has new pump and pressure tank.
There is a septic tank off the south side of the deck.
Center of the creek is the property line in the back.
Property has part of an old house, garage, and chicken coop.
I'm trying to be as upfront as possible about the work needed to make this place a nice home.
The property has potential with a nice private view off the back back.
The land down by the creek is private and would make an excellent garden area.
Cash As is 39k
Owner finance possible 45k with 20k down.

<span>$54900 / 2br - 800ft2 - Fixer/rebuild cabin near Maggie Lake (Tahuya, WA)</span><br />
<span>Small cabin of about 800 ft.sq., depending on someone's budget it can be brought back to life and used as is (with some work), or can be knocked down and rebuilt. I have gone back and forth between these two options for too long, and now realize neither will suit my needs, so it has to go.
Some of the work needed to get it liveable includes a small bit of roof work, some siding (one piece), some drywall, probably a bit of electrical, and some plumbing. So though things pretty much work as is, there are many improvements to be made if you want to keep the existing structure. It is far from move-in ready.
Details are too many to write, please ask any specific questions and I will answer them honestly. Has community water, newer septic. For a paltry sum of $85./yr. dues you get access to Maggie Lake, it's park, and garbage service.
Small lot of about .23 acres, has private driveway shared by just a few lots, you can see Maggie Lake through some trees. Speaking of trees, it sits among some very nice, some very large trees, mostly firs.
Inside I started to demo. a closet I thought was poorly placed, but that is all I did of that sort of work inside. Has been smoked in previously, we have removed all carpet and pad but some odor remains..
Looking for a cash-out sale, the only way we can consider any contract is with a substantial down payment, around $20K, and having us cashed out within 2-3 years max.
Location in ad is approximate, not where it actually sits. Motorcycle sold separately, if at all. If you see the ad it's still for sale, inquiries about availability will be ignored due to spambots, same thing for vague questions that are answered in the ad.
Any further questions please ask!
Thanks for looking!! </span><br />

<span>$45000 / 17500ft2 - .4 acre waterfront property on chimicum creek estuary (Port Townsend)</span><br />
<span>Now available is a magical little spot on chimicum creek's tidal estuary, about 6 miles from town, with much of that commute being possible on the Larry Scott. With water front access, you could kayak to all the way to alaska without needing to get in a car, or anchor your sailboat in nearby port townsend bay/hadlock, and row home. This sloped waterfront property offers a commanding view of the estuary from a nice flat area at the top. Enjoy amazing wildlife watching as great blue herons, kingfishers and occasional coyotes wander about below you.

With 175 feet of creek frontage, the property is 100 feet deep and comprised of 7 small lots, which together comprise 17,500 square feet(.4 acres), one of the few places in the area which will be large enough to build on after installing city water.

This is a truly beautiful area only 6 miles south of Port Townsend. Just off prospect ave, you are near the end of the road in the trees. I recommend this location for a minimalist, someone with a tiny house or dreams of building something 400 square feet or so. This will keep it simple, and lessen the impacts on this natural location.

1st image is a view of the property from the far side of the estuary. Second image is view from property.
Price is $45,000 obo- Serious inquiries only please.

IF YOU WANT TO BUY A HOME THIS IS A GOOD PLACE TO START

I will sit down with anyone regardless of their credit score, or where they are in the process of buying a home to see how I can help them get closer to home ownership.

I am a full time agent that works way beyond 40 hours a week helping people get there dream of home ownership.

This is an amazing time to purchase a home.

My clients tell me that buying a home was much easier than they thought it would be.

I have sold many homes to people who had told me when we first meet that they did not have enough or good enough credit to buy a home. They are so happy in their new home.

LET ME HELP YOU!

1. Please understand that if I do not advertise an address it is because the owner of the home does not want their address advertised on Craigslist. Mostly for security reasons. If you would like an address please email me and I would be more than happy to give it to you.


2. Some of the homes I advertise do have accepted offers on them but as a Real Estate Agent we must advertise every home until the deal closes. Owners of these homes would love to have back-up offers in place in case a deal falls through.


3. If you do email me I need you to know that your email address (if it even shows up on my email) NEVER gets sold or shared with anyone. </span><br />

<span>$39000 / 35719ft2 - Almost 1 Acre Very Close To Town - Subdividable - Possible Owner Carry (Port Angeles)</span><br />
<span>**I am willing to consider owner financing with the following terms: Purchase price $39,000, $15,000 down payment, and $24,000 paid over 5 years at 5% interest. This would be $452.91 per month** I still owe money on the property, so we would need to get a solid legal agreement to protect both parties.

The Neighbor across the road is really hopping for a golfing buddy! (seriously). But, even if your not into golf this location is exceptional. You are only minutes from downtown Port Angeles, but have a beautiful country setting. If you have a small plane the airport is just far enough away to not hear the traffic, but very convenient. Short drive to the Hwy, but far enough away to only hear the birds chirping :) All the splendor of the Pacific Northwest is on your future doorstep. This is the perfect piece of land to build your retirement dream, hide from the clogged up tiny city lots, or raise some country kiddos.

The land is about 35,720 Sq Ft, or almost an acre (0.82 acres) for sale at 9999 W. Courtney Rd, Port Angeles, WA 98363. 

I originally planned to build one or two houses on this property when I returned from the Army, but I changed my mind and stayed in Alaska :) 

There is water and power to the edge of the property, all of the major tree clearing was done in 2009, and there is only young growth brush and trees that need to be re-cleared. 

The legal description is CAIN, FIRST SUBDIVISION OF LTS 9-12 BL11. The land is fairly level and with a little buldozer work it could be very level. The zoning is LD. Dry Creek water share is needed, approx ($6,500). 

Property is not a wetland and is fully usable. The neighbor to the south (uphill) has an irrigation pipe draining onto my land so during heavy rain it may get wet for a little bit, but there is already a drainage ditch dug on the East side of the lot and the pipe simply needs to be routed to this ditch and covered. The land can be sub-divided, and the following septic systems can be used based on last p</span><br />
