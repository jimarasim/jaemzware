<span>U.S. military drops 22,000-pound bomb on Islamic State forces in Afghanistan</span><br />
<span>        U.S. forces in Afghanistan dropped a 22,000-pound bomb on Islamic State forces in eastern Afghanistan Thursday, the Pentagon announced in a statement. Gen. John W. Nicholson, the commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, said the bomb was “the right munition” to use against the Islamic State because of the group’s use of roadside bombs, bunkers and tunnels. It is the first time the bomb, called a GBU-43, has ever been used in combat. The GBU-43 is one of the largest airdropped munitions in the U.S. military’s inventory and was almost used during the opening salvos of the Iraq War in 2003. By comparison, U.S. aircraft commonly drop bombs that weigh between 250 to 2,000 pounds. This particular bomb is not the biggest in the Pentagon’s non-nuclear arsenal. The larger 30,000 pound GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator, designed for destroying heavily fortified bunker complexes, has never been used outside a test environment. While the GBU-57 is heavier, the GBU-43 has a larger warhead and explosive yield. The U.S. military has targeted similar complexes and dropped tens of thousands of bombs in Afghanistan, raising the question of why a bomb of this size was needed Thursday. It was unclear what the GBU-43 strike accomplished, as the bomb is not designed to penetrate hardened targets such a bunkers or cave complexes. A spokesman for U.S. forces in Afghanistan did not respond to a query regarding the bomb’s effects on its intended target, an Islamic State tunnel complex in Nangahar province. The Pentagon said in its statement that “U.S. Forces took every precaution to avoid civilian casualties with this strike.” The GBU-43 is an evolution of the unguided 15,000-pound BLU-82 bomb. First used in Vietnam, the C-130-launched BLU-82 was often dropped to turn patches of jungle into helicopter landing zones. This earned the BLU-82 the nickname “Daisy cutter.” The BLU-82 was used multiple times in the early stages of the war in Afghanistan when U.S. forces were closing on Os</span><br />

<span>Assad Defiant as Activists Report Surge in Syrian Government Attacks</span><br />
<span>A handout picture released by the Syrian presidency's press office shows Syrian President Bashar al-Assad during an interview with AFP in the capital Damascus, on April 12, 2017. Print See comments Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is remaining defiant amid widespread accusations his government carried out a deadly chemical attack last week, as monitoring groups say his forces along with Russia have escalated attacks on civilians in a clear challenge to the international community. In his first interview since scores were killed in an April 4 chemical weapons airstrike on Khan Sheikhoun, Assad told the French news agency AFP the incident was a "fabrication" to justify a U.S. military strike. "Our impression is that the West, mainly the United States, is hand in glove with the terrorists. They fabricated the whole story in order to have a pretext for the attack, It wasn't an attack because of what happened in khan Sheikhoun. It's one event, its stage one is the play that we saw on the social networking and on TVs, and the propaganda, and the stage two is the military attack," he said, adding that his country's forces handed over all of its chemical weapons in 2013. Assad said the "firepower" of his forces has not been diminished by the April 7 U.S. Cruise missile strike on al Shayrat, the airbase from where Washington says Syrian jets took off from to carry out a sarin gas attack. WATCH: Assad on use of chemical weapons in Syria      Rise in attacks

In the week since the attack on Khan Sheikhoun, the Syrian Network for Human Rights says there has been a rise in the use cluster munitions, incendiary weapons and barrel bombs by the regime, resulting in the deaths of at last 98 civilians, including 24 children. It also claims in a report released late Tuesday that toxic-gas grenades were launched by government forces in the Damascus suburb of al Qaboun. There has been on independent confirmation of that report. “On April 7, 2017, around 16:00, Syrian regime forces used</span><br />

<span>Doctor Dragged off United Plane Has Broken Nose and ‘Significant’ Concussion: Lawyer</span><br />
<span>by ERIK ORTIZ The bruised and bloodied passenger who was forcibly removed this week from an United Airlines flight lost two front teeth and suffered a broken nose and "significant concussion" in the ordeal, his lawyers said Thursday. Dr. David Dao, who fled war-torn Saigon before immigrating to America in 1975, was released from the hospital Wednesday, but will need reconstructive surgery and remains "shaken" by the experience, attorney Thomas Demetrio told reporters in Chicago. "He said that being dragged down the aisle was more horrifying and harrowing than what he experienced in leaving Vietnam," Demetrio said. Crystal Dao Pepper, one of Dao's five adult children, said at the same news conference that her father is "healing." "What happened to my dad should never have happened to any human being, regardless of the circumstance. We were horrified and shocked and sickened to learn what had happened to him and to see what happened to him," Dao Pepper said. A lawsuit has not been filed yet, but Demetrio says one is coming down the pike. Dao, 69, signaled Wednesday that he's gearing up for a legal fight by filing an emergency "bill of discovery" against the carrier in Illinois State Court in order to preserve evidence in the case, including all surveillance videos and cockpit voice recordings. Related: Here's Why It's Legal for Airlines to Kick You Off Your Flight Dao's dismissal from United Express Flight 3411 occurred while he and his wife, also a doctor, waited to depart Chicago for their home state of Kentucky. They had been vacationing in California and had a layover in the Windy City, Dao Pepper said. Attendants told passengers that the sold-out flight needed to make way for extra crew, and four people were being randomly selected to give up their seats in exchange for an $800 voucher. Dao was one of the chosen — but he refused to deplane. Security officers with the Chicago Department of Aviation were called on board to physically yank him off the flight despit</span><br />

<span>Trump Signs Law Taking Aim at Planned Parenthood Funding</span><br />
<span>Advertisement By JULIE HIRSCHFELD DAVISAPRIL 13, 2017 WASHINGTON — President Trump signed legislation on Thursday aimed at cutting off federal funding to Planned Parenthood and other groups that perform abortions, a move cheered by conservatives who have clamored to impose curbs on reproductive rights. The measure nullifies a rule completed in the last days of the Obama administration that effectively barred state and local governments from withholding federal funding for family planning services related to contraception, sexually transmitted infections, fertility, pregnancy care, and breast and cervical cancer screening from qualified health providers — regardless of whether they also performed abortions. The new measure cleared Congress last month with Vice President Mike Pence casting the tiebreaking vote in the Senate. The previous Department of Health and Human Services regulation, which took effect two days before Mr. Trump’s inauguration, said that states and localities could not withhold money from a provider for any reason other than an inability to provide family planning services. Mr. Trump has shown ambivalence about Planned Parenthood, voicing support for its health-related services other than abortion, and his daughter Ivanka has urged him to tread carefully on the issue, concerned about the possible political repercussions of the Republican effort to defund the organization altogether. As a middle ground, Mr. Trump has proposed preserving federal funding for Planned Parenthood if it stops providing abortion services. The organization has said it will never accept such a deal. And federal law already prohibits government funding for abortion, except in cases of rape or incest, or to save a woman’s life.

Regardless of his misgivings about the effort, Mr. Trump appeared ready to accept congressional Republicans’ idea of using a broad health care overhaul to strip</span><br />

<span>US berates Syria at OPCW meeting on Syrian chemical attack</span><br />
<span>        THE HAGUE, Netherlands — Syrian authorities — “abetted by Russia’s continuing efforts to bury the truth” — still possess and use chemical weapons, an American diplomat told the international chemical weapons watchdog on Thursday. The strong comments by Kenneth D. Ward, the American ambassador to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, came amid ongoing diplomatic skirmishes over last week’s deadly attack in Syria. Ward used a hastily convened meeting of the organization’s executive council to launch a withering verbal attack on Syrian President Bashar Assad and his allies in Moscow. The meeting was called to discuss the April 4 attack on the Syrian town of Khan Shaykhun that killed nearly 90 people. The United States and other Western governments blame Assad’s regime. Washington in retaliation launched missile strikes on a Syrian air base it said was the starting point for the chemical weapons attack, a move that ratcheted up tensions between the United States and Syria’s ally Russia. Russia and Syria claim the Khan Shaykhun victims were killed by toxic agents released from a rebel chemical arsenal hit by Syrian warplanes. Assad, in an interview with Agence France-Presse, denied that any chemical weapons attack took place. “Definitely, 100 percent for us, it’s fabrication,” Assad said in the video released by his office. “Our impression is that the West, mainly the United States, is hand-in-glove with the terrorists. They fabricated the whole story in order to have a pretext for the attack,” Assad said in his first comments since the U.S. missile strikes in response to the chemical attack. Assad denied having chemical weapons and said Syria would only allow an “impartial” investigation into the incident. But OPCW Director-General Ahmet Uzumcu told the meeting at the group’s headquarters in The Hague that the preliminary assessment of OPCW experts investigating the alleged chemical attack was “that this was a credible allegation.” He said i</span><br />

<span>18 Syrian Fighters Allied With U.S. Are Killed in Coalition Airstrike</span><br />
<span>Advertisement By HELENE COOPERAPRIL 13, 2017 WASHINGTON — An airstrike by the American-led coalition fighting the Islamic State killed 18 Syrian fighters allied with the United States, the military said on Thursday. The strike, on Tuesday in Tabqah, Syria, was the third time in a month that American-led airstrikes may have killed civilians or allies, and it comes even as the Pentagon is investigating two previous airstrikes that killed or wounded scores of civilians in a mosque complex in Syria and in a building in the west of Mosul, Iraq. Tuesday’s strike was requested by coalition allies who were on the ground near Tabqah, the United States Central Command, which oversees combat operations in the Middle East, said in a statement. The fighters had called in the airstrikes and “identified the target location as an ISIS fighting position,” it said, using another name for the Islamic State. Aleppo Raqqa Tabqah Location of strike ISIS control Homs SYRIA Damascus  The Central Command statement said that the target location turned out to be a “fighting position” for the Syrian Democratic Forces, who have been fighting the Islamic State alongside the United States. It was unclear whether the strike came from an American warplane or one from the other coalition partners.  “The coalition’s deepest condolences go out to the members of the S.D.F. and their families,” Central Command said in the statement, calling the episode “tragic.” Military officials said the cause is being investigated.

<span>Canada is poised to approve a law legalizing marijuana nationwide</span><br />
<span>        The government of Canada on Thursday released a plan to legalize recreational marijuana use across the country by July 2018. With a solid Liberal majority in government, the plan is widely expected to become law, but it would leave the details of implementation, including commercial regulations, to individual provinces. The bill’s backers framed it as an effort to reduce adolescent drug use and take profits out of the black market. “Criminal prohibition has failed to protect our kids and our communities,” Bill Blair, parliamentary secretary to the Justice Minister and one of the architects of the legislation,  said at a news conference. The bill will “make Canada safer,” added Blair, a former Toronto police chief. “Police forces spend between 2 and 3 billion dollars every year trying to deal with cannabis, yet Canadian teens are among the heaviest users in the Western world,” said Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale. “Criminals pocket 7 to 8 billion dollars in proceeds.” Marijuana legalization was a campaign promise of Prime Minster Justin Trudeau. The bill needs to be approved by Parliament, but Trudeau’s Liberal Party commands a solid majority there. The measure has also received support from the country’s Conservative Party. The legislation, titled “An Act respecting cannabis and to amend the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, the Criminal Code and other Acts”, would set a minimum age of 18 to purchase and use marijuana. That’s lower than the drinking age of 19 in most provinces. It’s also a departure from the norm in the United States, where states that have legalized recreational marijuana use have set the minimum age at 21. Individuals would be allowed to possess up to 30 grams of marijuana for personal use, similar to the one-ounce standard in U.S. states where marijuana use is legal. Households would also be allowed to grow up to four marijuana plants. While the bill would remove penalties for individual use and possession, it wouldn’t set up a n</span><br />

<span>Police Believe New York Judge Found in Hudson River Committed Suicide</span><br />
<span>Advertisement By ALAN FEUER, MATTHEW HAAG and WILLIAM K. RASHBAUMAPRIL 13, 2017 Family tragedy surrounded Judge Sheila Abdus-Salaam. About three years ago, law enforcement officials said, her brother committed suicide. Last year around this time, her mother died. On Wednesday, after responding to an emergency call, officers with the New York Police Department’s Harbor Unit found the body of Judge Abdus-Salaam, the first black woman to serve on New York State’s highest court, in the Hudson River in Harlem with no apparent signs of trauma and no indications of foul play. The police are treating her death as a suicide, although an investigation is continuing. According to one law enforcement official, Judge Abdus-Salaam called her Midtown Manhattan chambers on Tuesday morning to say she would not be coming in because she was not feeling well. When the judge failed to appear on Wednesday, her assistant sent a text to her husband of eight months, who called 911 to report her missing a short time later. Her body was found that afternoon, floating in the river by the shore near West 132nd Street. The judge was wearing a gray zippered sweater, black sweatpants, a gray T-shirt and New Balance sneakers, the official said. She also had a white watch on her wrist and a MetroCard in her pocket. Investigators do not believe that she had been in the river long. Advertisement Judge Abdus-Salaam was last seen leaving her office on Monday evening, and investigators tracked her to the subway — the No. 6 line — at about 8 p.m., the official said. Investigators found the judge’s cellphone in her apartment, another official said, and the door had been locked with keys from the outside. Both officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation is continuing.  “She was a lovely, genteel lady,” Jonathan Lippman, a former chief judge of New York State, said. “We’re all just shocked. No one has any idea what happened.” Since 2013, Judge Abdus-Salaam had been one of seven j</span><br />

<span>        Florida restaurant inspectors found numerous violations in the kitchen at President Trump’s private club, Mar-a-Lago. Inspectors from the Florida Department of Business & Professional Regulation cited more than a dozen violations in reports from a Jan. 26 inspection at Trump’s “winter White House” in Palm Beach, the Miami Herald first reported. The violations included several that were categorized as high priority, which “could contribute directly to a foodborne illness or injury,” according to the agency. In two kitchen coolers, the inspectors found that meats were not being stored at the proper temperature and that fish served raw or undercooked had not “undergone proper parasite destruction,” according to the reports.                                                                              </span><br />

Falcon, 55, had been on the lam since 1991, when his older brother Augusto "Willie" Falcon and fellow drug kingpin Salvador "Sal" Magluta were indicted by a federal grand jury. U.S. Marshals spokesman Barry Golden said investigators were surprised to find him living in a typical pink stucco home in a quiet, middle-class Kissimmee suburb. "Nobody thought Gustavo Falcon was still in the United States," Golden said. At his initial court hearing Thursday in Orlando, Gustavo Falcon agreed to be sent to South Florida to face charges of conspiracy to import cocaine into the U.S. He was ordered held without bond, court records show. Augusto Falcon and Magluta were small-time drug dealers when they dropped out of high school in the late 1970s to begin building their cocaine empire that would amass more than $2 billion, according to trial evidence. They eventually owned world-class ocean racing boats and lived like royalty. Mickey Munday, who did prison time for flying cocaine loads for Colombia's Medellin Cartel, said the pair was known for their honesty in business deals — legal or otherwise — and the expertise of their boat-building operation. They also drove flashy cars and lived in seaside mansions, even when murders and shootings linked to their organization brought police scrutiny. "They were so flamboyant," Munday said. "Everybody in the world knew what they were doing. Why attract attention to yourself?" Gustavo Falcon was not viewed as a top leader of the organization, and vanished just ahead of a 1991 indictment that charged </span><br />

<span>MS-13 gangsters suspected in Long Island quadruple murder linked to ongoing street war</span><br />
<span>Four young men were savagely murdered near a Long Island children’s playground, with violent local gangbangers suspected in the suburban slaughter, officials said. The corpses were discovered Wednesday night at the Recreation Village Park in Central Islip, with three of the murdered youths still in their teens, said Suffolk County Police Commissioner Timothy Sini. The butchered bodies were left behind for an undetermined amount of time by the fugitive killers. The victims “all suffered from significant trauma throughout their body,” the commissioner said Thursday. “It appears they were killed with a sharper edged instrument.” Six MS-13 gang members busted in Long Island teens' murders Without going into detail, Sini said the murder technique used was “consistent with the modus operandi of MS-13” — a violent gang already implicated in last year’s murders of two high school girls. The two best friends were attacked with a machete and baseball bats as they walked through town last September. “We are clearly looking into that possibility, although we have not ruled out any possibilities at this point,” said Sini. The commissioner said his department was working with the FBI on the quadruple homicide, and promised to keep the heat on the local gang. What is MS-13? A look at the widespread and violent gang “This is a long-term war,” said Sini. “And make no mistake about it, it’s a war.” The MS-13 street gang was founded in Los Angeles by immigrants seeking safe haven from a civil war in their native El Salvador during the 1980s. Crime scene investigators were seen still working in the park early Thursday, and several blocks around the area were cordoned off. It was not immediately known if the killings were connected to the gang-related homicides that took place in Brentwood — the town next to Central Islip — in the last few months. On March 2, eight members of the violent MS-13 gang were arrested for the revenge killings of Nisa Mickens, 15, and Kayla Cuevas, 16. The ho</span><br />

<span>        President Donald Trump likes a weaker dollar, and some corners of the market agree. Though the greenback’s knee-jerk reaction from Trump’s comments Wednesday has all but been reversed, the U.S. currency appears to be entrenched in a new range amid prospects of delayed policy from Washington and a slower pace of interest-rate hikes. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, slumping 4.5 percent since its January high, headed toward its worst week in nearly a month. For some traders this comes as welcome news. A lower dollar could lend support to sectors and asset classes battered by the 24 percent gain over the past five years. To be sure, many see the recent slump as only temporary thanks to a U.S. economy that remains on solid ground. However, should the greenback face continued weakness, these assets could see a bid. The U.S. dollar still rules as the most important currency in the world’s markets, which has in recent history created an inverse relationship between gold and the greenback. Declines in the dollar create demand for the safe haven, said Andrew Brenner, head of international fixed income for National Alliance Capital Markets. While the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index slumped 0.8 percent in the holiday-shorted week, gold rose 2.3 percent to trade at its highest since November. Consumers might end up seeing a higher bill at the gas pump if Trump gets his wish for a weaker dollar. “Typically, the U.S. dollar and commodities move inversely, hence should President Trump’s comments have their desired effect, he will inadvertently be encouraging a rally in oil prices -- ergo, gasoline prices -- as well as other commodities,’’ Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData LLC said in an interview. Such gains extend to shale oil producers, which stand to benefit from the U.S.’s increasingly large role as an exporter in the industry. Of course, the impact might not be quite as large as years past. “The oil market has such a surgical focus on OPEC product</span><br />

Shares of the nation’s biggest bank by assets rallied more than 1%, before falling back with the broader market, after the company reported a 17% jump in net income to $6.45 billion from a year ago with earnings per share up 22% to $1.65 – topping Wall Street expectations for $1.52 a share. Revenue rose 6% during the first three months of the year to $25.57 billion, easily topping forecasts for $24.88 billion. CEO Jamie Dimon, in a statement, said the company was “off to a good start” for the year as momentum in all of the bank’s businesses built on gains made in 2016. “U.S. consumers and businesses are healthy overall and with pro-growth initiatives and improving collaboration between government and business, the U.S. economy can continue to improve,” he said, pointing to growth in consumer loans and card sales volume. Recent figures on the health of the U.S. economy – including a preliminary reading Thursday on April’s consumer sentiment gauge from the University of Michigan, which rose further from a lofty reading in March, show Americans remain confident about their economic prospects. Indeed, the bank saw an 11% rise in average core loans and a 15% jump in credit card sales volume as consumers felt optimistic about taking on new debt.  Though confidence levels remain high, traditional retail players like Macy’s (M), Sears (SHLD), Ralph Lauren (RL) and a host of others, continue to suffer from changing shopping habits as consumers gravitate to e-commerce platforms rather than bricks-and-mortar stores to make purchases.

<span>Wall Street Dreams of Apple-Disney Megamerger</span><br />
<span>   Investors are increasingly considering whether Apple should buy Walt Disney Co. to give both companies a major boost as the consumer technology and entertainment industries continue to converge, RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani observed in a report on Thursday. The analyst said he favored such a deal, but didn't offer any evidence that either company was actually working on the theorized transaction. A combination would strengthen both companies, giving Disney stronger distribution for its content as consumers turn increasingly to their mobile devices, while Apple could build the Internet-based video service it has long sought, Daryanani wrote. Apple would need to pay $237 billion for Disney, or $157 per share, using a combination of cash and debt, the analyst estimated. "We currently place a 'greater than 0%' probability on the notion that (Apple) is seriously considering (Disney) as an acquisition target," the analyst wrote in a 27-page report. "More important is whether or not the market is giving it a serious consideration, and our conversations suggest that investors are giving such a transaction far more consideration than they were three or six months ago." Fortune reached out to Apple and Disney for comment and will update this story if responses are received. Growing interest in an Apple-Disney mega-merger on Wall Street comes after Apple CEO Tim Cook and other executives hinted several times that they might be looking for a media company to acquire. Apple executives also reportedly discussed acquiring Time Warner (TWX, -0.64%), home of HBO and the Warner Bros. studio, before AT&T (T, -0.74%) snapped up the media titan for $109 billion including debt last fall.

<span>Galaxy S8 sales are already explosive</span><br />
<span>Android fans are about to be divided into two groups: those who buy a Galaxy S8 or Galaxy S8+, and those who wish they had a Galaxy S8 or Galaxy S8+. Consumers haven’t even yet had the chance to experience Samsung’s 2017 flagship phones for themselves, but they already know these phones are something special. Samsung’s nearly edgeless “Infinity Display” combines with curved sides on the front and back of the phone to create a look and feel that are as close to perfect as any company has come so far, considering current technological limitations. Samsung already said Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ pre-orders have outpaced last year’s Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, and now the company has offered actual pre-order figures that are impressive, to say the least.    Samsung announced earlier this week that global Galaxy S8 and S8+ pre-orders are outpacing the previous-generation models. The company noted “strong double-digit growth,” but failed to offer any firm pre-order figures. While Samsung is still being tight-lipped with global pre-sales figures, it has now shared pre-order numbers for the local market in South Korea — likely in part to make a statement to local rival LG, which already began selling its new flagship phone, the LG G6. Samsung’s mobile business boss Dong-jin Koh told on Thursday reporters in South Korea that combined pre-orders of the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ have now reached 728,000 units in South Korea alone. That figure was at 620,000 just two days ago, which means that Samsung has averaged more than 50,000 new pre-orders per day since then. Also of note, that initial 620,000 figure included 150,000 high-end 128GB Galaxy S8+ models, which cost more than $1,000 each. “China is the market we can never give up. Although we have had a hard time over the past two years in the market, we believe Chinese consumers will react to and recognize good products,” Koh told reporters in South Korea, according to local news site The Korea Herald.

<span>Instagram Stories hits 200M users, surpassing Snapchat as it copies its AR stickers</span><br />
<span>   “Move last and take things” seems to be Facebook’s new motto. Now the parent company’s top Snapchat clone Instagram Stories has hit 200 million daily active users, surpassing the last count of 161 million that Snapchat announced alongside its IPO. Instagram Stories launched in August, hit 100 million dailies in October, and 150 million in January, so it’s hardly slowing as it grows. Meanwhile, Instagram is getting faster at copying even Snapchat’s most technologically advanced features with a series of global iOS and Android updates. Exactly one year ago, Snapchat launched augmented reality “3D stickers” and text you can stick to objects in videos, which then stay stuck to them and grow or shrink as they move around. Today Instagram launches a clone of this feature called Pinning for stickers and text, with an added improvement of a video timeline for scrubbing back and forth for picking when to Pin something and demoing how it looks. Snapchat launched these augmented reality stickers a year ago; Instagram added them today Instagram tells me Pinning relies on “fairly standard region tracking technology,” and was built because “we see people frequently sharing their lives through videos, so we wanted to enable our stickers to move through videos as one more way to mix your personality with the moments you’re capturing.”  Instagram also now has its own version of Snapchat’s Scissors feature that launched in December for cutting out a part of an image, turning it into a sticker and pasting it on whatever you’d like. Instagram’s “Selfie Stickers” lets you open a camera from the Stickers dock, shoot a mini-selfie, add a fade or circle frame to it and then paste it into your images from then on. But you can’t just cut something out of your already shot content. Instagram is adding Custom Geostickers drawn by local community members for Tokyo, Madrid, London and Chicago. It launched this copy of Snapchat’s illustrated geofilters last month in New York City and Jakarta.</span><br />

<span>T-Mobile US, Dish, Comcast dominate 600 MHz incentive auction, Verizon a no-show</span><br />
<span>CHANNELS T-Mobile US, Dish Network and Comcast walked away as the highest bidders in the Federal Communications Commission’s 600 MHz incentive auction process, with the three accounting for $15.9 billion of the auction’s $19.8 billion in net proceeds. T-Mobile US led the charge, with the nationwide operator posting nearly $8 billion in winning bids. The carrier, which said it would be aggressive in the low-band spectrum auction, picked up 1,525 total 10-megahertz licenses covering 414 of the auction’s 428 partial economic areas. While auction leading, some had predicted the carrier would spend up to $10 billion, as it had been active in stocking its coffers ahead of the process. Dish Network continued to bolster its spectrum holdings, with the satellite-television company picking up 486 licenses covering 416 PEAs for $6.2 billion. The company participated in the auction under the ParkerB.com Wireless name. Dish – and its bidding partners – bid nearly $14.5 billion during the FCC’s previous two spectrum auctions in a move to bolster its already bulging spectrum portfolio. However, the company, which has yet to launch a commercial service taking advantage of its spectrum holdings, was forced to return $3 billion of the licenses from the AWS-3 auction due to irregularities in handling the designated entity status. Comcast was the auction’s third-largest bidder, picking up 73 licenses covering 72 PEAs for $1.7 billion. The cable television giant has been a frequent participant and winner in past FCC spectrum auctions, though has sold off most of its winnings in the secondary market. The company did recently move on long-simmering plans to launch a mobile service using a mobile virtual network operator agreement with Verizon Wireless gleaned from one of those license deals. The only other bidder to top $1 billion in total gross winning bids was Columbia Capital-backed Channel 51, which acquired eight licenses covering five PEAs.

<span>Farewell, NES Classic Edition</span><br />
<span>   Nintendo had a bonafide – and apparent surprise – hit on its hands with the NES Classic Edition. But like all good things, its time is done. This afternoon, the company confirmed with TechCrunch that, “Throughout April, NOA territories will receive the last shipments of Nintendo Entertainment System: NES Classic Edition systems for this year.” It’s not definitive language. The company won’t officially confirm that its sunsetting the product, but taken with another comment it offered up separately, this month looks like the last time for the foreseeable future those of us in North America will be able to get our hands on the emulator through standard retail channels. “NES Classic Edition wasn’t intended to be an ongoing, long-term product,” Nintendo of America said in another statement. “However, due to high demand, we did add extra shipments to our original plans.” In other words, consider yourself lucky if you managed to get one the first — or second — time around. And indeed, the original tongue-in-cheek press release tied to the mini-console points to a limited supply offering aimed at holiday shoppers. Of course, the initial retail bottleneck only served to increase excitement in nostalgia-fueled gen Xers and production was ramped up with a “steady flow of additional systems through the holiday shopping season and into the new year.” The release did, perhaps, take some of the shine off of the company’s new console, the Switch, with its unbeatable price of 30 (mostly) iconic games packed into a $60 machine. But if Nintendo opts to keep the system dead forever, it certainly feels like it’s cutting off its nose to spit its mustachioed face here. After all, a hit is a hit – and as it’s happily said with regard to mobile hits like Pokemon Go and Super Mario Run, anything that brings newfound attention to the company’s IP goes a ways toward driving sales of new titles and systems.

Survivor's Jeff Varner in Therapy After Outing Zeke Smith as Transgender: 'This Changed Me Drastically' BY DAVE QUINN•@NINEDAVES POSTED ON APRIL 13, 2017 AT 1:17PM EDT     Jeff Varner knows he crossed the line on Wednesday’s Survivor when, in an effort to save himself from elimination, he outed fellow contestant Zeke Smith as transgender  — insinuating Smith’s reluctance to share his most personal information made him deceitful. It was a shocking and distasteful moment that immediately backfired on the 50-year-old former news anchor. Tears coming out of his eyes, he buried his head in his hands and quickly apologized for what he said — but his words wouldn’t be forgotten. Not only was Varner unanimously voted out of the game by his tribemates, but everyone from host Jeff Probst to viewers watching at home have since chastised Varner for his targeted attack.  But no one has beaten up Varner more than Varner himself. On Thursday morning, he called into EW Morning Live (Entertainment Weekly Radio, SiriusXM, channel 105) to discuss the episode — and admitted that he’s been in therapy since filming it. “I have spent 10 months stewing in this awful, horrible mistake I have made,” Varner said. “I have been through, I don’t know how much therapy. With the show’s therapist, with a local therapist. I have met with and spoken to several LGBT organizations — I’ve joined the board of a couple of them…. this has changed me drastically.” As tough as it’s been for him, Varner recognizes that Smith, 29, is the real victim here. “This is about Zeke,” Varner said. “I can only profusely apologize. I have apologized to him — we’ve spoken several times on the phone. He continually forgives me. I am amazed and moved at his ability to do that. I know that forgiveness is difficult. I know that he has a lot of people in his ear. I know that watching this last night was traumati</span><br />

<span>Dave Chappelle honors late friend and ‘Chappelle’s Show’ writer Charlie Murphy at John Mayer concert</span><br />
<span>Dave Chappelle paid an emotional tribute to his friend and "Chappelle's Show" writer Charlie Murphy during a surprise appearance at a John Mayer concert Wednesday. "Today I got some terrible news. My good friend Charlie Murphy passed away this morning, and everybody in comedy is heartbroken," he said from the stage of the Schottenstein Center in Columbus, Ohio. The notoriously private comedian called Mayer, his longtime friend, a "sight for sore eyes" on such a tough day. He said Mayer's song "You're Gonna Live Forever in Me" reminded him of "my friend Charlie Murphy — our friend Charlie Murphy." Secrets of Charlie Murphy's pancakes with Prince "Much more than a friend," Mayer said, "and author of my favorite phrase, 'habitual line-stepper.'" The famous phrase was coined by Murphy as he described Rick James during his wildly popular "Chappelle's Show" segment, "Charlie Murphy's True Hollywood Stories." "Rick James was a habitual line-stepper," Chappelle said from the stage Wednesday night, mimicking Murphy's hilarious delivery. Murphy's series on the show was based on his real-life experiences after his younger brother Eddie Murphy shot to superstardom. Chris Rock, other comedians react to Charlie Murphy's death In one iconic sketch, he recalled Prince challenging his crew to a basketball game — and how the "Purple Rain" singer ran circles around him. "Oh my God, John, I remember when we did those sketches," Chappelle said Wednesday night. "I remember calling Prince and asking him to do the sketch, and Prince just being like, 'No.' That was the whole conversation." Chappelle ended up playing the role of Prince, while Murphy played himself. Prince later regretted turning down the offer, Chappelle said. "He told me after the fact, he said, 'I wished I had done the sketch,'" Chappelle told the audience in his home state of Ohio. Charlie Murphy, 'Chappelle's Show' star, dead at 57 At Chappelle's request, Mayer played "Your Gonna Live Forever in Me" in honor of Murphy. </span><br />

<span>APRIL 13, 2017 8:07am PT by Aaron Couch Thursday kicked off a celebration 40 years in the making — with surprise guests and a touching tribute to Carrie Fisher.  The 40 Years of Star Wars panel at Star Wars Celebration featured generations of castmembers from a galaxy far, far away to mark the 40th anniversary of Star Wars: A New Hope, which opened in May 1977.  Surprise guests George Lucas and Harrison Ford sparked pandemonium, while Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy was joined by previously announced guests Mark Hamill, Anthony Daniels, Ian McDiarmid, Peter Mayhew, Billy Dee Williams, Warwick Davis and prequel star Hayden Christensen. Davis hosted the festivities, introducing a behind-the-scenes reel looking back at how 1977's A New Hope launched a phenomenon. (Scroll to the beginning of the video below to see the panel.)  In a tear-jerking moment, an interview with Carrie Fisher played over footage of her hugging fans. "It's about family, and that's what's so powerful about it," said Fisher. "They are showing the films to their children and their grandchildren. They're sharing something that moved them as a child." Kennedy took the stage to thank fans who camped out on the street for a seat to the panel and make a surprise introduction of Lucas. Davis and Lucas sat down and took a moment to acknowledge Fisher and the late Kenny Baker, who played R2-D2 and died in August 2016. Lucas admitted his pitch for Star Wars may have seemed outlandish — after all, it involved "dogs flying space ships." But he was appreciative of the studio for taking a chance on it. "The idea was to do a high adventure film that I loved when I was a kid with meaningful, psychological themes," said Lucas.  Lucas admitted he wasn't supposed to say this, but he described A New Hope this way: "It's a film for 12-year-olds." "You're 12 years old. You're going to go on in the big world. You're moving away from your parents being the center focus. You're probably scared, you don't know what's </span><br />

<span>The Murdochs Assess the O’Reilly Damage</span><br />
<span>Advertisement By EMILY STEEL and MICHAEL S. SCHMIDTAPRIL 12, 2017 Bill O’Reilly left Fox News this week for a long-planned vacation to Italy and the Vatican, with his fate in the hands of a Murdoch family calculating the risks and rewards of keeping him on or forcing him out of the network. Facing a boycott by advertisers, unrest inside the company, protests outside Fox News headquarters and public calls for human rights investigations into company culture, Rupert Murdoch and his sons, Lachlan and James, are reckoning with the fallout of a sexual harassment scandal that has once again engulfed Fox News and its parent company, 21st Century Fox. The Murdochs are awaiting the results of an investigation into Mr. O’Reilly’s conduct before making a decision about whether he will stay or go, two people briefed on the plan said Wednesday. The law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison has been enlisted by 21st Century Fox to investigate, and although the probe started with a review of accusations made by Wendy Walsh, a former guest on Mr. O’Reilly’s show, the law firm is expected to expand its purview if other issues arise, the people said. The calculation on whether to keep Mr. O’Reilly is complex and rests in part on a generational divide between Rupert Murdoch, 86, who controls 21st Century Fox, and Lachlan, 45, and James, 44, who have top leadership positions at the company. Advertisement Rupert Murdoch, a cleareyed businessman whose priorities often are driven by the bottom line, has long backed Mr. O’Reilly as the Fox News host’s career has soared and pulled the network up along with him. The sons, while also business-minded, have worked to modernize the company’s workplace, which has been the target of repeated allegations of sexual harassment.  Ousting Mr. O’Reilly — in the wake of an investigation by The New York Times that found multiple settlements related to sexual harassment allegations against him — could alienate his fans, create programming challeng</span><br />

<span>   It has become obvious to most anyone who has spent time around Russell Westbrook that he doesn't like being crowded. He's a neat freak who despises clutter, so when it comes to personal space, Westbrook is looking for every opportunity to get some breathing room. He stands a step back in the team line during the national anthem, avoiding any potential shoulder-to-shoulder contact. During breaks, he always takes his seat on the very last chair on the end of the bench. After shootaround, he shoots in a corner of the practice facility, by himself. He arrives at the arena some three hours before home tipoffs, going through his warm-up without any teammates on the floor with him. This season, Westbrook and the Thunder decided to move his postgame media availability away from his locker -- one that sits alone in the locker room without a teammate on either side -- and to the middle of the room in front of a whiteboard to keep reporters from hovering around his locker. When Westbrook makes his way in for any interview, Thunder Director of Basketball Communications Matt Tumbleson will announce, almost like a procession is commencing, "Make way for Russell, please." And Westbrook will stand in place, sometimes awkwardly, until a hole is formed with ample space to walk through without touching anyone. "He used to get frustrated and go sideways, but he's able to now sit down, snap out of it, come back." Thunder F Nick Collison, on the changes he saw in Russell Westbrook When Kevin Durant decided to join the Golden State Warriors on July 4, Westbrook spoke with Thunder general manager Sam Presti and immediately asked, "What's next?" The answer was to consider signing an extension, a move to stabilize the organization and create a road map forward in a post-Durant world. But before he made up his mind, Westbrook needed some space. Officially, it was a month to the day after Durant left that Westbrook re-signed with the Thunder, but in reality, the decision was made a couple </span><br />

atrick Beverley talks to everyone. Go to a team practice, and his voice can be heard pinging around the floor. Find him after a game, and he’ll turn a weak question around on an unsuspecting reporter. Tell him a teammate attended a Beyoncé concert, something he says he would never do, and he’ll spend several minutes trying to figure out who it was. (It was James Harden, he finally deduces.) Ninety minutes before the Rockets and the Grizzlies face each other in Houston in early March, Beverley starts talking to me. “You going to chapel?” Beverley is upbeat, even buoyant, as he sweeps through the locker room like he owns the place. In a sense, he does: the five-year veteran has seniority as the longest tenured Rocket, drafted in the second round a couple months before the Harden trade. Clearly, he doesn’t want me to feel left out. I ask if I can be his plus-one. “Yeah, come along!” We both know it won’t happen. Media members aren’t allowed within the sacred confines of a pregame chapel service, typically a 10-minute affair involving both teams. But Beverley’s invitation was in good faith. He really wanted me to attend. He tries inviting a few more non-athletes in the room, before giving up and heading out the opposite door. This expression of faith seems a bit antithetical in the context of the Houston locker room. After all, the Rockets aren’t just known as one of the league’s analytical pioneers, but have fully built their team off unfeeling data. The space where the players reside on game day is a reminder of those beliefs. A long, continuous LED board stretches horizontally above the players’ lockers, alternatively displaying the league leaders in several advanced statistical categories. Where most teams play chronological footage of their opponent’s most recent game, the Rockets group various plays together, like pick-and-rolls and screens, and even show tendencies for the referee crew assigned to this game. It’s all a reminder that hard evidence is valued. Bu</span><br />

<span>KEEPING UP WITH THE WARRIORS FORCED THE NBA TO EMBRACE ITS FUN SIDE IN 2017</span><br />
<span>By using this site, you agree to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.  Kevin Durant chose the Golden State Warriors over the summer, the superteam was formed, and a lot of people said it was over before it started. One thing becoming super, however, does not mean everything else turns rotten. This NBA regular season proved that. It wasn't solely about the rich getting richer. What needs to be understood was how those other guys built off the team-first momentum that the Warriors' style of play established in past seasons. Houston's James Harden and Cleveland's LeBron James especially increased their emphasis on setting up teammates for open threes this season—the well-known Warriors way—and the superstar images of The Beard and LeBron were enhanced rather than dampened by taking the edge off their individual scoring. Stars in today's game are now judged more by a willingness to sacrifice their scoring to win. This is a copycat league where coaches are always stealing from other coaches, a place that famously featured those Michael Jordan-Larry Bird anything-you-can-do-I-can-do-better McDonald's commercials. And the Warriors' community approach to basketball reached a new height of renaissance this season. It wasn't Golden State that just set the new NBA three-pointers record for a season; it was Houston and Cleveland. The Rockets and Cavaliers both made at least 1,000 threes this season, the first time two NBA teams have ever accomplished this feat in a single NBA year.  The fact that three-point kingpin Stephen Curry of the Warriors knew off the top of his head the obscure statistic of just how many more three-pointers the Rockets attempted compared to the Warriors is a reflection of how the rest of the NBA—and especially Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni—has kept trying to challenge the Warriors. "They shoot a lot of them—more than we do by like nine a game or something like that," Curry said. "If a team has the talent and have shooting threats around the court, it [th</span><br />

<span>The Orlando Magic fired general manager Rob Hennigan on Thursday after a five-season tenure without a playoff appearance, team CEO Alex Martins announced. Assistant general manager Matt Lloyd will take over as interim GM and will be considered for the full-time job. The team is slated to have the No. 5 overall pick with a 10.3 percent chance of winning next month's draft lottery. Assistant general manager Scott Perry was also fired. Coach Frank Vogel, who led the Magic to a 29-53 record and their fifth straight last-place finish in the Southeast Division, is in the first year of a long-term contract and is expected to be retained.  Can Orlando's rebuilding project be salvaged? What moves should the Magic make next? Kevin Pelton breaks down their options after firing GM Rob Hennigan.  Hennigan, 35, was the NBA's youngest general manager. "We appreciate Rob's efforts to rebuild the team, but feel we have not made any discernible improvement over the last few years specifically," Martins said in a statement. "It's time for different leadership in basketball operations. We certainly wish Rob and his family well." League sources say Orlando has interest in hiring former Magic star Grant Hill as its new face of basketball operations, but sources told ESPN's Marc Stein on Thursday that Hill has no plans to leave his minority ownership role with the Atlanta Hawks. As ESPN reported March 20, Golden State Warriors assistant general manager Travis Schlenk and Detroit Pistons executive Pat Garrity are expected to emerge as candidates for the GM post. Schlenk broke into the league with Orlando, and Garrity is another former Magic player. The Magic were 132-278 (.322) -- the second-worst mark in the NBA -- during Hennigan's tenure. His draft record was not strong as he made three top-five picks -- Victor Oladipo, Aaron Gordon and Mario Hezonja -- and failed to produce an instant star. Several of his major trades also fizzled, the most recent being the acquisition of Serge Ibaka </span><br />

<span>        Scientists have identified the oldest known relative of the dinosaurs and are expressing surprise at how little it actually resembled one. Researchers on Wednesday described fossils of a long-necked, four-legged, meat-eating reptile called Teleocrater rhadinus. It reached up to 10 feet long and prowled across what is now Tanzania, in East Africa, about 245 million years ago. Teleocrater lived during the Triassic Period, millions of years before the first dinosaurs.

<span>Soldier Ants Come to the Rescue of Wounded Comrades</span><br />
<span>In a behavior never seen before in an insect species, predatory ants were observed to retrieve wounded comrades on the battlefield and then bring them back to the nest for recovery. Sounds noble, but these ants—who spend their days attacking termites—are simply being pragmatic.   The sub-Saharan Matabele ants are specialized termite predators. Anywhere from two to four times each day, around 200 to 500 soldiers of this species align themselves in long columns and march toward termite foraging sites. During these unprovoked attacks, large ants (called majors) break open the nest, and smaller ants (dubbed minors) rush in to kill the termite workers. The ants then haul their dead prey back to their nest. But the termites aren’t completely helpless. Over the millennia, termites have evolved a number of ways to fight back, including powerful jaws and the formation of a social caste dedicated to fighting off the predatory Matabele ants. Consequently, the soldier ants can expect a good fight, and when battle ensues, injuries are common. As a new study published in Science Advances shows, this “arms race” between the ants and termites has now taken an unexpected turn. During a recent field expedition to Comoe National Park in Ivory Coast, a research team from the University of Würzburg in Germany documented a countermeasure never seen before in an insect species—rescuing behavior. As the authors write in their new study:   We show that a unique rescue behavior in [Matabele ants], consisting of injured nestmates being carried back to the nest, reduces combat mortality. After a fight, injured ants are carried back by their nestmates; these ants have usually lost an extremity or have termites clinging to them and are able to recover within the nest. After studying the ants in more detail, the researchers learned that wounded or distressed ants cry out for help by discharging two chemical signals, dimethyl disulfide and dimethyl trisulfide, which are secreted through glands in</span><br />

<span>Eels May Use 'Magnetic Maps' As They Slither Across The Ocean</span><br />
<span>RAE ELLEN BICHELL Young European eels (Anguilla anguilla) are called "glass eels" at that stage because they're transparent except for a dark spine down the middle.  Researchers have found that European eels can sense magnetic fields and may use this ability to navigate thousands of miles through the Atlantic Ocean. Eels have always been mysterious animals. More than 2,000 years ago, Artistotle proposed that they were born spontaneously from mud. "I think it's fascinating because as humans we've been pondering the life history of eels for a long time," says Lewis Naisbett-Jones, a graduate student in marine biology at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. He's one of the humans that, all these years later, is still pondering eels. No one has ever seen eels spawning or collected their eggs in the wild. But it's now known that the vast majority of eels in Europe and North America are born in the same place — deep in the Atlantic Ocean in a warm spot northeast of Cuba known as the Sargasso Sea. After they're born, the baby eels make an epic journey, sometimes traveling thousands of miles to their new homes in rivers and lakes from North America to North Africa to Scandinavia. "It's pretty crazy," says Naisbett-Jones, who at the time of the study was at Aberystwyth University in the U.K. He wanted to know how those little eels do it. Other scientists had found that eels can somehow sense the Earth's magnetic field, an ability dubbed "magnetoreception" that sounds like something out of the movie X-Men. Naisbett-Jones wondered if it eels picked up on those magnetic signals to guide their long journey home. To find out, he rounded up about a thousand young European eels (Anguilla anguilla), each about the length of a pinky finger and delicate as noodles. At that stage, they're called "glass eels," because they're transparent except for a dark spine down the middle. He spent a summer wrangling those baby eels into contraptions he built that imitated the Earth's ma</span><br />

<span>Astronomers May Finally Have the First Picture of a Black Hole</span><br />
<span>GENIUS An illustration of the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way.            For the monster at the Milky Way’s heart, it’s a wrap. After completing five nights of observations, today astronomers may finally have captured the first-ever image of the famous gravitational sinkhole known as a black hole. More precisely, the hoped-for portrait is of a mysterious region that surrounds the black hole. Called the event horizon, this is the boundary beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape the object’s gargantuan grasp. As the final observing run ended at 11:22 a.m. ET, team member Vincent Fish sat contentedly in his office at the MIT Haystack Observatory in Westford, Massachusetts. For the past week, Fish had been on call 24/7, sleeping fitfully with his cell phone next to him, the ringer set loud. As the last of the data arrived at project observatories, he watched celebratory comments come pouring in on a special chat line for radio astronomers and engineers. One noted that he was about to open a bottle of 50-year-old Scotch. Another was listening to the triumphant chords of Bohemian Rhapsody. “I’m very happy and very relieved, and I’m looking forward to getting a good night’s sleep,” Fish says. But that sense of relief is tinged with anticipation: So much data takes time to process, and the team must wait months to find out if their massive effort was truly a success. “Even if the first images are still crappy and washed out, we can already test for the first time some basic predictions of Einstein's theory of gravity in the extreme environment of a black hole,” says radio astronomer Heino Falcke of Radboud University in Nijmegen, The Netherlands. Introduced in 1915, Einstein’s revolutionary theory says that matter warps or curves the geometry of space-time, and we experience that distortion as gravity. The existence of extremely massive black holes was one of the first predictions of Einstein’s theory. (Read "Einstein's Relativity Affects A</span><br />

<span>Kids Who Use Touchscreen Devices Sleep Less at Night</span><br />
<span>Touchscreen devices like smartphones and tablets are now fixtures of many households, so it comes as little surprise to learn that young children who don’t work or go to school are among their most active users. In the first study of its kind, researchers have learned that infants and toddlers who spend more time on these devices sleep less at night. It’s a troubling finding, but the reasons for these sleep disruptions are still unclear.   Traditional screen time, like television and video games, has been linked to sleep problems in children, but less is known about portable touchscreens, such as smartphones and tablets. In the first study to investigate potential links between touchscreens and sleep in young children, a research team led by Tim Smith from Birkbeck University of London has found that the same sleep disruption effect applies to these modern devices. By surveying parents about their kids’ touchscreen use and sleep patterns, these researchers have found that every additional hour of tablet or smartphone use among children between the ages of six months and three years results in about 15 minutes less total sleep. These findings now appear in Scientific Advances. From June 2015 to March 2016, the parents of 715 infants and toddlers aged six months to 36 months (3 years) participated in the online survey. Roughly 70 percent of the parents surveyed owned a touchscreen device of some kind. In these households, 75 percent of young children used a touchscreen on a daily basis. Amongst children who had daily access to touchscreens, 51 percent were between the ages of six to 11 months, and 92 percent were between 25 to 36 months.   Parents were asked to report on the average duration of their child’s daytime and nighttime sleep, the time it typically takes for their child to fall asleep, and the frequency of their night awakenings. When parsing the results, the researchers controlled for age, sex, TV exposure, and maternal education. According to their findin</span><br />

<span>Detroit-area doctor charged with performing genital mutilation on girls</span><br />
<span>        A Detroit emergency room doctor has been charged with performing genital mutilation on young girls in what is believed to be the first criminal case of its kind brought by U.S. prosecutors. Jumana Nagarwala, 44, of Northville, Mich., was charged in federal district court in Detroit with female genital mutilation, transportation with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity and making a false statement to a federal officer, court records show. In a criminal complaint, FBI Special Agent Kevin J. Swanson alleged that two young girls traveled with their parents from Minnesota so Nagarwala could perform the procedure on them in early 2017, and that investigators had identified other children who might have been victimized between 2005 and 2007. The Justice Department said the case is believed to be the first brought under the particular U.S. law that criminalized female genital mutilation. “According to the complaint, despite her oath to care for her patients, Dr. Nagarwala is alleged to have performed horrifying acts of brutality on the most vulnerable victims,” Acting Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Blanco of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division said in a statement.  “The Department of Justice is committed to stopping female genital mutilation in this country, and will use the full power of the law to ensure that no girls suffer such physical and emotional abuse.” [Widespread Female Circumcision Highlights the Plight of Kurdish Women] Female genital mutilation — or removing all or part of a female’s genital for nonmedical reasons — is considered a human rights violation, though it is practiced extensively in some African countries and areas of the Middle East, according to UNICEF. A June 2016 report from the Government Accountability Office found that increased immigration from countries where it is practiced had brought it to the United States, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that in 2012, 513,000 women and girls h</span><br />

<span>Target issued a recall for water-absorbing egg toys ahead of Easter Sunday.  (Consumer Product and Safety Commission ) Target has issued a massive recall for water-absorbing egg toys ahead of Easter Sunday after discovering the object can expand inside a child’s body, causing life-threatening conditions if ingested. The affected products were sold at Target stores from February 2017 through March 2017, WCVB reported.  About 560,000 of the toys were sold under multiple product names including Hatch & Grow Easter Eggs, Easter Grow Toys and Hatch Your Own Dino, the report said. The Hatch & Grow Easter Eggs and Easter Grow Toys have model number 234-25-1200.
