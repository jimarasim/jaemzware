<span>Charleston shootings: Dylann Roof photos found online</span><br />
<span>Images have surfaced online that appear to show the gunman that killed nine people at an African-American church in South Carolina posing with a gun.The collection of photographs discovered on a website also show 21-year-old Dylann Roof burning the US flag and visiting a slave plantation.In one image he is shown staring down the camera while sitting on a chair in camouflage trousers holding a gun.It is unclear who posted the images on the site, which was found on Saturday.The website also carries a racist manifesto, the provenance of which is also unknown. Internet records suggest the website's domain was registered in February but it is unclear who was behind it.A law enforcement official, quoted by AP, said the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was looking into the website.Data from the images show many of them were taken in April and May this year.Many of the photographs show Mr Roof posing with the Confederate flag, a symbol used in the US south during the civil war when south</span><br />

<span>Is the suspect in the attack which killed nine people at an African-American church in Charleston, South Carolina being treated differently because he is white?That's what many argued online. After the arrest of 21-year-old Dylann Roof, several images went viral comparing the way the case has been talked about - and how the suspect was treated by police - to other incidents involving black people accused of much less serious crimes. Here are some of the most shared.This picture compares the way Roof was arrested with the case of Eric Garner, the unarmed black man in who died after being arrested by New York City police officers in July 2014. The decision of a grand jury not to press charges against officer Daniel Pantaleo was greeted by protests, both online and on the street.The image has been widely shared in the last day across social media - with one version getting over 200,000 shares on Facebook.This was the most circulated image under the "Black Lives Matter" hashtag in the fir</span><br />

<span>Charleston shooting: Who are US white supremacists?</span><br />
<span>An attack on an African-American church in South Carolina that has left nine dead is thought to be racially motivated.The suspected gunman Dylann Roof has been pictured wearing white supremacist iconography and reportedly told his black victims: "I have to do it... You rape our women and you're taking over our country, and you have to go."Here we look at who the white supremacists are in the United States and what defines them.Like any sub-culture, they are far from a homogenous grouping but what defines them is hatred - usually directed at race and the government.Weapons are a key part of their ideology: far-right websites dedicate entire sections to recommending what guns and other weapons to buy.Nazi ideology is one symbol seen in nearly all far-right groups, with tattoos of swastikas common.That Caucasian/Aryan people are from a superior gene pool, and that all other minorities are inferior. There is a particularly embittered hatred towards black people linking back to slavery, bu</span><br />

<span>Greek debt: New proposals to be put to creditors</span><br />
<span>A Greek minister has said new proposals will be put to creditors ahead of an emergency EU summit planned for Monday.State Minister Alekos Flambouraris also told Greek media he believed the European Central Bank (ECB) would not allow Greece's banks to collapse.Reports say billions of euros have been withdrawn from Greek banks in the past week.The summit comes amid attempts to prevent Greece defaulting on a €1.6bn (£1.1bn) IMF loan repayment.The European Commission, the IMF and the ECB are unwilling to unlock bailout funds until Greece agrees to reforms.They want Greece to implement a series of economic changes in areas such as pensions, VAT and on the budget surplus before releasing €7.2bn of funds, which have been delayed since February.Details of the new proposals have not yet been released.Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has said he believes "there will be a solution based on respecting EU rules and democracy which would allow Greece to return to growth in the euro".But German C</span><br />

<span>At least three people are dead and dozens injured after a man drove his car into crowds in a square in Austria's second largest city of Graz.The driver has been arrested, though police say there were no indications the attack was motivated by terrorism.Part of the city was sealed off, with large numbers of ambulances and helicopters sent to the scene.The square in Graz was hosting an event related to the Austrian Formula 1 Grand Prix, which is being held nearby.The regional governor confirmed that three people had died and 34 were injured, some seriously.Hermann Schuetzenhoefer told reporters that the suspect was a 26-year-old man who was "mentally unbalanced"."There is no explanation, there is no excuse," he added. Austrian Chancellor Werner Faymann also said he was deeply shocked by the incident.Sixty ambulances and four helicopters were sent to the scene.Eyewitness Helmut Reinisch told the BBC he saw bodies lying on the ground "covered in blood," including a young boy.He added that</span><br />

<span>Muhammad cartoons will be aired on TV - Geert Wilders</span><br />
<span>A Dutch far-right leader says cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad will be broadcast on Dutch TV despite them not being aired as he intended on Saturday.Geert Wilders said a "misunderstanding" with the network meant they were not broadcast on a slot on national TV allocated to political parties.The controversial cartoons were shown at an event in the US last month that was attacked by two gunmen who were shot dead by security guards.Mr Wilders was a speaker at that event.The airing of the cartoons was supposed to be a key moment for Mr Wilders in what some Muslims have described as his crusade against Islam, according to the BBC's Anna Holligan in The Hague.But instead of cartoons, the slot allocated to Mr Wilder's Freedom Party featured an old recording about migrants.A furious Mr Wilders shared the film on social media after it failed to appear on TV.The images feature a bearded man in various guises.

<span>Chilean woman 'carried calcified foetus for 50 years'</span><br />
<span>Doctors in Chile say that a woman has been carrying a calcified foetus for some 50 years.Chilean media say the woman, who is at least 90, went to hospital in the city of San Antonio after a fall.X-ray tests then revealed the presence of a foetus which weighed around 2 kilos (4.4lb).The phenomenon, known as a lithopedion, occurs when a foetus dies during pregnancy and then becomes calcified outside the uterus.Previous recorded cases have also involved women being unaware of the presence of the foetus until decades later.Marco Vargas Lazo, the director of the hospital called the case "extraordinarily rare," according to the Efe news agency.The foetus was "large and developed and occupied all of her abdominal cavity," he said.The patient has now been sent home and doctors say it is unlikely they will attempt to remove the foetus, given the risks an operation would carry for a patient of her age.Images appear online purportedly showing Charleston church shooting suspect Dylann Roof with f</span><br />

<span>Police in central China have arrested 13 people after hundreds of villagers attacked a police station on Friday.Residents of the village, in Hunan province, were reportedly angry about the handling of a young woman's death last month.Officials say the death was caused by pesticide poisoning, but relatives have accused her husband of involvement.Her relatives beat the husband and took local officials hostage when they attempted to intervene.In a statement reported by state media, the police said that the trouble began on Thursday after the family displayed the woman's corpse in her mother-in-law's house.When police attempted to defuse the situation they were attacked and forced to kneel before the deceased woman, the statement adds.Hundreds of villagers joined the bereaved relatives the next day to protest and attack the local police station.The police say that hundreds of officers were called in to restore order.Images appear online purportedly showing Charleston church shooting suspe</span><br />

<span>Security officials in Burundi say 11 policemen have been injured in overnight grenade attacks in the capital Bujumbura.Blasts and gunfire were heard across the city during the simultaneous attacks on police posts and vehicles.The attacks took place in districts that have seen protests against President Pierre Nkurunziza's intention to seek re-election.Since his announcement in April Burundi has also seen a failed military coup.Police have blamed the attacks on opposition activists. A senior police official told AFP one of the officers was seriously injured.It is possible that violence will escalate ahead of parliamentary and presidential elections next month, says the BBC's Africa Editor Mary Harper.Burundi's main opposition leader has said he will participate in next month's presidential election if certain conditions are met.Rights groups say at least 70 people have been killed and 500 wounded since the protests began in April, with more than 100,000 fleeing the country.The oppositi</span><br />

<span>A roadside bomb in Afghanistan has killed at least 12 members of the same family, including women and children, in southern Helmand province.The blast struck the family's van in the Marjah district, a Taliban stronghold, local police chief Nabil Jan Mullahkhail told reporters.Several people were injured and the death toll could rise, he added.Violence has increased across the country since the departure of most US and Nato forces last year.The family had been fleeing the area after hearing a government offensive against the Taliban was imminent, a relative told the AP news agency.The attack is yet to be claimed by any group but the Taliban routinely plant roadside bombs in the area to target Afghan security forces.In February, the United Nations said more than 10,000 civilians had been killed or injured in Afghanistan in 2014, the highest number since 2009.That figure included 3,699 civilian deaths, up 25% from 2013.Images appear online purportedly showing Charleston church shooting s</span><br />

<span>The Earth has entered a new period of extinction, a study by three US universities has concluded, and humans could be among the first casualties.The report, led by the universities of Stanford, Princeton and Berkeley, said vertebrates were disappearing at a rate 114 times faster than normal.The findings echo those in a report published by Duke University last year.One of the new study's authors said: "We are now entering the sixth great mass extinction event."The last such event was 65 million years ago, when dinosaurs were wiped out, in all likelihood by a large meteor hitting Earth."If it is allowed to continue, life would take many millions of years to recover and our species itself would likely disappear early on," said the lead author, Gerardo Ceballos.The scientists looked at historic rates of extinction for vertebrates - animals with backbones - by assessing fossil records.They found that the current extinction rate was more than 100 times higher than in periods when Earth was </span><br />

<span>American author James Salter, who was often dubbed the "greatest writer you've never read," has died aged 90.Several famous writers were among his fans, including Philip Roth and Joseph Heller, but he never converted critical acclaim into commercial success.A former US fighter pilot, he flew in the Korean War alongside future astronaut Buzz Aldrin, who became the second man to walk on the moon.He died on Friday at a gym near his New York state home, his publisher said.Salter wrote his first novel, The Hunters, in 1956 during the Korean War and became known for exploring masculine themes like conflict - provoking comparisons to Ernest Hemingway.Speaking to the BBC in 2013, he said: "Having been to war satisfies a certain classical definition of manhood. To have seen war is some kind of pillar of manhood, and I felt that at the time."The Hunters was made into a Hollywood film in 1958 starring Robert Mitchum but his five later novels received far less attention.He published his final nov</span><br />

<span>Children with good memories 'tell better porkies'</span><br />
<span>Children who have a good memory are better at telling lies, say child psychology researchers.They tested six and seven-year-olds who were given an opportunity to cheat in a trivia game and then lie about their actions.Children who were good liars performed better in tests of verbal memory - the number of words they could remember.This means they are good at juggling lots of information, even if they do tell the odd fib.Writing in the Journal of Experimental Child Psychology, researchers from the Universities of North Florida, Sheffield and Stirling, recruited 114 children from four British schools for their experiment.Using hidden cameras during a question-and-answer game, they were able to identify the children who peeked at the answer to a fictitious question, even though they were told not to.A potentially surprising finding (for parents) is that only a quarter of the children cheated by looking at the answer.Further questioning allowed the researchers to work out who was a good li</span><br />

<span>Culture wars rage on for conservatives</span><br />
<span>On the eve of what could be a landmark US Supreme Court decision enshrining gay marriage as a constitutional right across the country, evangelical conservatives converged on Washington DC to talk politics and size up Republican presidential hopefuls.Just last year the epitaph was being written on the so-called culture wars in the US. Social conservatism appeared to be on the ropes, as the New York Times heralded the fact that Democratic candidates were no longer afraid of touting their support for issues like gay rights and birth control.And while many of the Democrats ended up losing in a mid-term election rout, the religious activists who attended this week's Faith and Freedom Coalition event in the nation's capital still feel at risk - and not just because Friday's activities were interrupted by what DC police called a "credible" bomb threat."We are told that church and state must be kept separate," an online video promoting the conference intoned.

The whole thing was a young girl who was being gang raped by five people.""What was shocking was that these people were aware of a camera, they were getting it all recorded. They were laughing and there was this huge sense of gloating."The video was shown to her by a man who attended one of her public talks, and whose own cousin had shared it.Krishnan realised it was one of many such videos doing the rounds in a shocking and perverted subculture which seems to have many adherents in India.The "scene" is driven by rapists themselves who share the vid</span><br />

<span>Syria's Druze under threat as conflict spreads</span><br />
<span>A recent attack on Druze villagers by radical Islamist rebels in Syria has raised fears about the fate of the country's secretive sect.At least 20 Druze were shot dead by the al-Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front in the north-western province of Idlib.It was the deadliest attack on Druze civilians since the beginning of the country's conflict four years ago.Fighting has spread to areas where Druze predominate. They are the third-largest religious minority in Syria and are considered by jihadists as heretics.The Druze religion arose from Ismailism, a branch of Shia Islam, in the 11th Century.It takes its name from Mohammed bin Ismail al-Darazi, a mystic from Central Asia who regarded the third Fatamid caliph of Egypt, al-Hakim, as an incarnation of God.In 1021, al-Hakim disappeared under mysterious circumstances. Druze believe that he will reappear at the end of time to establish universal justice.Al-Hakim's successor, al-Zahir, rejected his claim of divinity and persecuted the Druze, forcin</span><br />

<span>The Irish rite of passage in the US</span><br />
<span>The tragic death of five Irish students when a balcony fell off a building in California on Tuesday drew attention to a longstanding Irish student tradition - a summer of work, and travel, in the US. So many young people make the trip that it's become almost a rite of passage to adulthood.For many young Irish people, who often live at home for their university years, it's the first time they get to experience complete freedom, out of sight of their parents.They are usually on a tight budget, packed into bedrooms like sardines in a tin. They may have to use their ingenuity to find work before their cash runs out.It's also a chance to have fun. There's a long tradition of students altering the date of birth on their driving licence so that they appear to be over 21 - the minimum age for buying alcohol in the US. However, a report on the balcony collapse in the New York Times, which described the J-1 work-visa programme as an "embarrassment for Ireland" thanks to a series of episodes inv</span><br />

<span>How do singers protect their voices?</span><br />
<span>Professional singers treat their voices a bit like athletes treat their bodies, writes singer and broadcaster Mary King.The best protection is a good posture and sound vocal technique. Voices always need to be supported by the bigger muscles in the body - poor posture can lead to muscular tension and vocal strain. There are also other factors which might be less obvious.Singers need to keep their bodies hydrated, so that the delicate vocal folds (or cords) can be kept supple. They would probably drink between two and three litres of water spread out throughout the day. The water would be at room temperature, rather than ice-cold.A number of factors contribute to dryness, so singers avoid caffeine, red wine and, wherever possible, air-conditioning. Smoke, of course, in whatever form, is a really bad idea.Hydration in the form of steam (head over a bowl of boiling water, with a towel over your head), is seen by many singers as the very best way to get the folds hydrated, and to shift th</span><br />

<span>The man who grows fields full of tables and chairs</span><br />
<span>At first glance it is a typical countryside scene. Deep in the Derbyshire Dales, young willow trees stretch upwards towards the late spring sun. Birds, bees and the odd wasp provide a gentle soundtrack to the bucolic harmony.But laid out in neat rows in the middle of a field are what appears to be a rather peculiar crop.On closer inspection these are actually upside-down chairs, fully rooted in the sandy soil.Slender willows sprout out of the ground then after a few inches the trunk becomes the back of a chair, the seat follows and finally the legs. The structure is tied to a blue frame and the entire form is clothed in leaves.Surveying the landscape in front of him is Gavin Munro, co-founder of Full Grown, the company he formed to put a childhood vision into practice."The concept is pretty straightforward. Rather than cutting down trees and making furniture I wanted to grow the trees in the shape of chairs, mirrors, lamps and so on."On the next row along, elegant spirals are growing </span><br />

<span>He was the British man who charmed locals with his praise for their country. Only problem was - he wasn't real.In Azerbaijan, there's been a lot of sensitivity over the country's international reputation during the inaugural European Games. So people were pleased when James Bonar, ostensibly a tourist from London visiting to watch the first European Games, was effusive in his praise for the country on national television. The country is wonderful, he said, and Azeri food is delicious to boot. Bonar was interviewed in the resort city of Mingachevir as part of a news segment broadcast on a commercial pro-government Azeri station, LiderTV.But raw footage later posted online showed Bonar coming across very differently. He had a thick accent and a very poor command of English - in other words, whoever he was, he was clearly not a British tourist.The footage was viewed thousands of times on Facebook and prompted huge discussion online.LiderTV later said they were duped by the pro-opposition</span><br />

<span>Inside Tadmur: The worst prison in the world?</span><br />
<span>When Islamic State seized Palmyra in Syria last month, one of the first things it did was blow up the Tadmur prison - the country's most notorious jail, where for decades, political dissidents were detained and tortured. The BBC's Soumer Daghastani looks back at its history.Westerners know Palmyra for its ancient Greco-Roman ruins, but the Arabic term for the place, Tadmur, gives most Syrians goose-bumps.It's synonymous with death, torture, horror, and madness.The prison was built by the French in the 1930s, in heart of the desert, about 200km northeast of Damascus. But it was during Hafez al-Assad 30-year rule between 1971 and 2000 that it gained its current reputation. Thousands of political dissidents were reported to have been humiliated, tortured, and summarily executed there."It's utterly unfair to call it a prison. In a prison you have basic rights, but in Tadmur you have nothing. You're only left with fear and horror," says Palestinian writer Salameh Kaileh, who spent two year</span><br />

<span>Charleston church shooting: Obama's 'hopeless' push for gun control</span><br />
<span>Another shooting, another sombre statement by President Barack Obama and another call for gun control.But this time was different - and so was much of the response from conservatives."At some point, we as a country will have to reckon with the fact that this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries," Mr Obama said on Thursday morning.He continued: "I say that recognising the politics in this town foreclose a lot of those avenues right now. But it would be wrong for us not to acknowledge it. And at some point it's going to be important for the American people to come to grips with it, and for us to be able to shift how we think about the issue of gun violence collectively."At some point - as in not today, not tomorrow and probably not anytime soon.And that's the reality of gun control in this country. As Mr Obama clearly understands, if a person can walk into a school, murder 20 children and public policy on this issue doesn't change - as happened in the 2012 N</span><br />

<span>Denmark election: Anti-EU party sets Rasmussen tough task</span><br />
<span>The centre-right bloc which won Denmark's general election has begun negotiations to form a new government.The bloc's leader, Lars Lokke Rasmussen, looks likely to succeed Helle Thorning-Schmidt as prime minister.But difficult talks lie ahead. Mr Rasmussen's own Venstre (Liberal) party saw great losses in Thursday's poll, and the biggest party in the right-bloc is now the anti-immigration Danish People's Party (DPP).As a result, the bloc that will rule Denmark is likely to be very different from the one Mr Rasmussen led when he was prime minister in 2009-2011.We have yet to fully understand the roots of the DPP's success, but its calls for tougher asylum policies combined with demands for border control seem to have paid off, amid concern over the public cost of immigration.It was expected to make huge gains, but on election night it was clear that it had done even better than expected - increasing its share of the vote by 8.8%.The DPP took 21.1% of the vote, while Venstre - the party</span><br />

<span>Is facial recognition tech really a threat to privacy?</span><br />
<span>Facebook has decided not to offer its photo-sharing app Moments in Europe because of regulator concerns over its facial recognition technology.And earlier this week, talks between US tech firms and privacy campaigners broke down over fears about how the industry is planning to use the tech.So why is there so much concern over facial recognition tech, and is it justified? We unpick some of the issues.Not really. The concept of using cameras to recognise people has been around for decades - CCTV has become all but ubiquitous in our cities. And the public has, by and large, accepted the trade-off between privacy and protection. CCTV images are routinely used as evidence in court and have helped identify and prosecute many criminals.Cameras have been good at recording people doing things but not so good at identifying them as individuals - unless your face was already on a database. And even then, CCTV images were often so blurry that facial recognition software was unable to make a match</span><br />

<span>Oyez, Oyez. The US Supreme Court is heading towards the final decisions of its 2014 term - including major opinions on gay marriage and President Obama's healthcare law. The court can have broad and deep impact, but who are the nine justices who have such an outsized influence on American life? Meet the Supremes.Elena KaganOn the court since: 7 August 2010How she got to the court: Kagan grew up in New York City. At the age of 12, she convinced her rabbi to hold the synagogue's first formal bat mitzvah, the rite of passage for young women. After law school at Harvard, she clerked for Justice Thurgood Marshall. After a successful stint as the first female dean of Harvard Law School, she was briefly US solicitor general - the federal government's top representative at the US Supreme Court, before being nominated by President Barack Obama for the high court.Who is she as a justice?

Last updated at 13:24 GMTVenue: Spielberg Dates: 19-21 JuneLive text and radio commentary via BBC TV, radio and the BBC Sport website and app, plus extended highlights on BBC television. Full coverage details here.Lewis Hamilton headed a Mercedes one-two in qualifying at the Austrian Grand Prix despite both cars going off on their final laps of the session.Hamilton did enough on his first lap in the top 10 shoot-out, lapping 0.2secs quicker than team-mate Nico Rosberg.Hamilton then spun at Turn One on his final lap, leaving Rosberg the chance to beat him, only for the German to spin at the final corner on his lap.Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel was third from Williams's Felipe Massa.It was nip-and-tuck whether Rosberg would have beaten Hamilton - he was slower than the world champion in sector one, but quicker in sector two.But then Rosberg ran wide on the exit of Turn Eight, got the car partly onto the kerb and then lost control as he went into the final corner."It was quite </span><br />
