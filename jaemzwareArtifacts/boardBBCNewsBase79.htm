<span>New York considers salt warning on menus</span><br />
<span>New York City is considering introducing new rules requiring restaurants to warn customers of food with a high salt content.Chain restaurants that serve dishes with more than the recommended daily amount of sodium, one teaspoon, would have to add a salt-shaker symbol next to the item.New York is the first US city to consider such a move.Restaurant owners said it would mean yet more red tape for the industry.New York's Board of Health agreed to consider the plan on Wednesday, which means a final vote in September and possible introduction in December.</span><br />

<span>Fatal A400M crash linked to data-wipe mistake</span><br />
<span>A military plane crash in Spain was probably caused by computer files being accidentally wiped from three of its engines, according to investigators.Plane-maker Airbus discovered anomalies in the A400M's data logs after the crash, suggesting a software fault.And it has now emerged that Spanish investigators suspect files needed to interpret its engine readings had been deleted by mistake.This would have caused the affected propellers to spin too slowly.The aeroplane crashed near Seville, during a test flight on 9 May, killing four crew members on board.</span><br />

<span>Sir Tim Hunt 'sorry' over 'trouble with girls' comments</span><br />
<span>A Nobel laureate has apologised for any offence after he made comments about the "trouble with girls" in science - but said he had "meant to be honest".Sir Tim Hunt, who is a Royal Society fellow, reportedly told a conference in South Korea women in labs "cry" when you criticise them and "fall in love" with their male counterparts.He told the BBC he "did mean" the remarks but was "really sorry".The society said Sir Tim's comments did not reflect its own views.Sir Tim, 72, who was awarded the Nobel prize in physiology or medicine in 2001 for his work on how cells divide, reportedly told the World Conference of Science Journalists: "Let me tell you about my trouble with girls. Three things happen when they are in the lab: you fall in love with them, they fall in love with you, and when you criticise them they cry."</span><br />
