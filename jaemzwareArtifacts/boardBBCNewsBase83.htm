<span>Philae comet lander wakes up, says European Space Agency</span><br />
<span>The European Space Agency (Esa) says its comet lander, Philae, has woken up and contacted Earth.Philae, the first spacecraft to land on a comet, was dropped on to the surface of Comet 67P by its mothership, Rosetta, last November.It worked for 60 hours before its solar-powered battery ran flat.The comet has since moved nearer to the Sun and Philae has enough power to work again, says the BBC's science correspondent Jonathan Amos.An account linked to the probe tweeted the message, "Hello Earth! Can you hear me?"</span><br />

<span>The latest round of talks between Greek and EU officials in Brussels has failed to reach an agreement.A European Commission spokesman said while that progress was made on Sunday, "significant gaps" remained.Europe wants Greece to make spending cuts worth €2bn (£1.44bn), to secure a deal that will unlock bailout funds.Greek deputy prime minister Yannis Dragasakis said that Athens was still ready to negotiate with its lenders.He said Greek government proposals submitted on Sunday had fully covered the fiscal deficit as demanded.</span><br />

<span>Israeli 2014 Gaza war actions 'lawful', report says</span><br />
<span>The Israeli government has issued a report into the 2014 war in Gaza, saying that its military actions were "lawful" and "legitimate".Israel made "substantial efforts" to avoid civilian deaths, it said.The militant group Hamas, which dominates the Gaza Strip, called the Israeli report worthless.It comes ahead of the publication of a UN inquiry into possible war crimes committed during the war, a report Israel dismissed as a waste of time.The 50-day conflict between Israel and Gaza militants, lasted from July to late August 2014. It left at least 2,189 Palestinians dead, including more than 1,486 civilians, according to the UN.</span><br />
