his group of jocks started walking towards a thin kid, known as Kyle

to pick up his things, unaware that one of Axyl’s friends was about
to kick him in the rear from behind. Axyl signaled his friend (known
as Cale Omnous) and the jock gave him a swift kick up Kyle's bum.
Such a powerful blow like that made Kyle fall forward and hit his
head against the lockers, thus falling onto the ground. The whole
group roared with laughter, with Axyl smiling with his arms crossed.
“You better tie your shoelaces too, buddy-boy.” The group finally
left, after Cale projected a wad of phlegm, from his nose, and onto
Kyle's trapper keeper. Kyle could hear how proud Cale was thanks to
his pig-like laughter, after performing that unnecessary stunt.</FONT></P>

smile like gorgeous waning crescent. The jocks, the nerds, the
“stoners,” the “emo’s” and the “rockers” all knew of
her, and none wouldn't hesitate to “get with her.” Other girls,

acting and performing on stage, while Holly appreciated playing her

in saving it. With his stomach swirling everywhere in his body, Preox
opened a trap door above him. Rig was sucked through the trap door
and Preox activated his jet-pack, from his Vambit, and flew out of
the ship quickly. He saw a falling Rig, bawling his eyes out, and
caught him with his masculine arms. Rig stopped bawling, once Preox

blow, which Preox and Rig had received from falling debris, the
Misara Serum was gone… out of the hands of the ones who had a major
responsibility in keeping it captive and out of the Adoa’s sight.
For a detailed insight, the Misara Serum was contained in a black
container. And there’s a reason as to why it was considered deadly,
being the fact that the Adoa were the creators. With a weapon of mass
destruction, there was really no telling what the Adoa was capable of
doing with it. The Asids stole the Serum because they knew well of
the the Serum’s capabilities. The leader of the Adoa, Zjok, created
this Serum shortly after betraying the Asids, long ago. Zjok invented
the Serum to become supremely powerful and successful leader, as
reigning his own militia of Adoa Mazers and Strikers. The Serum,
being as dangerous as it was, was also told that it could grant super
powers. </FONT>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt">	The
Serum was made of a toxic blood found from the extinct species, known
as the Drokensmur. After the last Drokensmur died off, Zjok was able
to extract its blood. Once he got the blood, he mixed it with hot
boiling lava and ice from a comet. After he obtained these materials

social network of </FONT><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt"><I>Bookface</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt">,
so all his Mazers and Strikers could see. He tested the Serum on a
rat and once the rat barely took no more than a couple of samples,
the rat immediately grew twice its size and began flying around its
cage. The rat opened its mouth and breathed fire like a dragon and
began bending the bars of his cage, with his own paws. Zjok laughed
his evil laugh and blasted the rat dead, with a big ray gun. His
horrible, ugly face came to camera and simply said, “Adoa, we will
now rise!”</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt">	Oh,
and they did rise. Over the course of ten Earth years, Zjok’s Adoa
had become a stronger Empire, destroying dozens of other species and
colonizing other planets as their own. The Asid Military was
prepared, however, once Zjok eventually threatened their planet,
Suzia. Preox and Rig were sent on a suicide mission to collect the
Misara Serum (Once Zjok had created it), on the Adoa's home planet,
Fleek. The mission was a complete success. After Zjok’s Serum was
stolen, while he was conveniently asleep, Rig actually managed to
drop the Misara Serum during a celebration party. Obviously, Rig
would do something as clumsy as it was and after the Misara had
dropped, the lid snapped off, spilling a puddle of the fluids onto
the ground. Preox had resealed the lid tight. As for the puddle of
Serum, well, Rig offered to lick it off the floor. After this
unthinkable act, Rig had obtained his powers, powers of the last
Drokensmur. </FONT>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt">	“No!”
yelled Preox. “Don't you dare! We don’t know what the
capabilities―” And the puddle was gone. </FONT>

They realized the amazing advantages they have achieved when
possessing the Serum. The Serum was too deadly, however, according to
the Asid Council and it had to be disposed of properly.
Unfortunately, the Serum was impossible to evaporate and it could not
be touched without turning into a living weapon. However, planet
Strom was the perfect planet to do research and plan on how to
destroy it, without being ultimately detected by Zjok’s forces. So,
the Asids made a rendezvous point to their base on the planet.
Everything was going great, up until the Adoa had relocated their
theives.</FONT></P>

sharp, stinging, fiery pain got worse! He rushed into the men's

vomited inside the toilet. He had barfed three times, before he
realized that he was belching no ordinary vomit. The toilet started
to melt, turning into a pile of what looked like mushy clay. Then,
the substance, which Axyl had released from his mouth, oozed slowly
out of the melting toilet. “What?” Axyl started. He was too
astounded from the sight of hot, boiling lava oozing. He scrambled up

only “better looking” from his own perspective. After setting his

of Holly and how beautiful she was, Axyl flexed his bicep for only a

He wasn't so sure what to decide and he felt silly just thinking
about it because he thought it would be great to show off his powers
and eventually get Holly to swoon over his heroic stature. He did
know plenty about superheroes and comic books. Some of them would
hide their secret identity, some would not. If Axyl were to become an
actual superhero, it would be a pain in the ass hiding his true
identity from everyone. There would be a lot of interference with
work, hanging out with friends, and especially attending school. This
was actual reality, not a comic book, and hiding his true identity as
a superhero would also be difficult. This was something Axyl had to

about Holly Ransfield and his destiny to ask her out on a date.

a related note, Axyl simply had no damn clue as to how he was going
to win the likes of Holly. She tossed a substantial amount of hot
black coffee in his face! So why should Axyl even bother to try?
However, Axyl didn’t let Holly’s hatred bother him too much. His
confidence clogged his mind from anything that appeared to intercept
his admiration towards the independent female, because he believed he
knew so much about girls in general. Axyl, in all respects from his
peers, happened to be the one to give dating advice to those who
needed it; even though his advice was completely biased and
manipulative (What Axyl didn’t know was that Holly was much, much
smarter than that.) He then remembered dating a younger girl in his
sophomore year of high school, a girl named Velouria Lancelot. Axyl
believed that his experience with Velouria could be used as an
advantage to get to know Holly better. However, Velouria was compared
to be the complete opposite of Holly’s intentions of being in a
relationship. Velouria was very affectionate, Holly was not. What
happened to Vel’s and Axyl’s relationship? Long story short, he
was bored of her constant devotion and atrociously dumped her. Her
heart was shattered. </FONT></FONT>

wanted him dead for it. </FONT></FONT>

was mentioned earlier that Zjok betrayed the Asids long ago. But this
was due to the lack of respect from others, battling constant
ridicule, and following his selfish perspectives of rule. To make a
long story short, Zjok’s strategic ideas for warfare and other
related conflicts were exemplary. However, other Asids did not think
so. Enraged, Zjok was ultimately moved from good to evil. Thanks to
the Adoa, who accepted his devilish plans for conquest (such as
colonizing other planets and creating unnecessary weapons of mass
destruction), Zjok was able to rise through power, making him and his
small fleet of Adoa the most dangerous force the Asids have ever
faced. </FONT>

Zjok was also equipped with a Vambit. He also wore an expression of
pure distress and anger; it had been plenty hours since his Misara

the past six days, Axyl had been making trips to the junkyard, twice
as often, to practice his super abilities (And it wasn't too
difficult to avoid Bobby's threats to call the police. How does Axyl
do this? Well, the simplicity of staying further away from Bobby, and
pretending he was a stray cat, seemed to do the trick.) In other
news, Axyl had been bothering Kyle more than usual, with his constant
questioning about Holly and what her interests were. Axyl couldn’t
simply walk up to Holly and ask her these things, because he knew she
would kick his ass to the curb. He seemed to be more comfortable
asking these redundant questions about his crush towards Kyle
because, after so many years of bullying him, Axyl knew he would
never fight back. Kyle found it surprising that Axyl wasn’t
actually threatening him to give him the information he needed, but
was being rather annoying and completely unavoidable. Finding it
frustrating to deal with the consistency, Kyle knew that Axyl had a
desperate crush on Holly and he knew that Axyl was willing to
apologize for all the suffered torment. </FONT></FONT>

the past five years of his life. As Kyle continued to crack up, Axyl
slammed his palm on the roof of his car, giving Kyle a sudden jolt of
fear. “Oh, Jesus! Haha! Please don't beat me up! But seriously, are

sections, nearby. There was Von Alan, who had managed the firearms
department. As being a middle-aged man, being very efficient with any
sort of weapon, and being exceptionally mechanically-inclined, he was
the man of the hour when it came down to hunting game. There was also
a younger-aged woman by the name of Sayra Haro, who was working in
the electronics. Sayra was just in her early twenties, as an expert
in musical instruments, and even owning her own group of mariachi

getting really intense. Will Blue Lazer trade his life to save two

right at the moment of demanding questions. The “single mother”
happened to have mace in her jacket. She brought it up to Evil
Nacho's face and sprayed diligently. The spray had no effect on the
monster, but in fact started to embrace the spray in his mouth. “Mm,
breath spray! Thank you, madam,” Evil Nacho said. “Did you
actually think that stuff is harmful to the MIGHTY EVIL NACH―?”

beautiful Monday morning, a lovely day in March, and it all started
with Axyl lazily descending down the stairs. His dad, Jared, was
sitting at the kitchen table, wearing a coffee-stained t-shirt and
boxer briefs, and flipping through the newspaper. Axyl made his way

finished his cereal, got ready for school, and was walking out the
door when Jared hollered, “Good luck with the rest of your baseball
season, son!” Axyl paused. The baseball state districts! He had
forgotten all about it! The thought of Blue Lazer and Evil Nacho

planet Strom was not far from Zjok's reach. That's what a few Asids
had little knowledge of, after surviving the epic Adoa invasion from
not so long ago. The invasion of which Preox and Rig barely escaped.
Eight Asids had also survived, but were ultimately stranded on the
planet Strom, with no means of communication or transport. Everything
was destroyed of what used to be the Asids’ military base. Piles of
burning dead soldiers were piled in several piles, scrambled all over
the area, the weather was cold and damp, as it was eerily quiet.
Planet Strom was an empty, mildly-weathered planet, and with the only
form of shelter destroyed, the Asids were left to die.</FONT></FONT></P>

had no idea what their new leader was capable of and they were unsure
as to whether enjoy it, or be truely afraid of it at the same time.

looked at him strangely. Not only Axyl just admitted that he will
protect Kyle, if Cale were to start a quarrel, but against Cale
himself. Kyle couldn't believe how different Axyl was behaving. Axyl
was somewhat becoming a good person; finally seeing how much an ass
he and Cale have been to poor, poor Kyle. Kyle nodded with a faint
smile. He, remarkably, knew he could trust Axyl, who was now his
ex-rival. This also proves that Axyl does not take too kindly of
Cale's behavior. On a more unfortunate note, Axyl knew what Cale
could do to Kyle, IF he so much as see him in public, other than
talking to Velouria. Axyl let his thought process roam his mind, as
he thought about the risks that could come upon him and Kyle. He
didn’t want to screw over Cale, but he knew Velouria and Cale was
not the best fit for her. After seeing the two in school, kissing and
holding hands every now and again, Cale is an awful boyfriend. Axyl
was not just doing this for Kyle, but also for Velouria. When she and
he dated, Axyl was about as crappy as Cale was, which also raises
concern about Axyl’s pursuit for Holly’s heart. Axyl had to try
for Holly, and he wouldn’t allow himself to give up. </FONT></FONT>

hung over the tips of her shoulders, along with the small groups of
freckles on her rosy cheeks, made her flourish like a tulip. Kyle was

watched her drive in the direction of where the bus had gone to

eventually driving on a bridge, the Dansko Bridge, which was close to
his house. Axyl couldn’t believe what had just happened! It was as
if he were in some sort of science fiction movie. Some thing,
possibly from outer space, had crash-landed somewhere in the Kingzing
area! Axyl saw people pull to the side of the road to admire the
sight of thick smoke left from the falling object. The smoke was
blue, with a mix of pure white, which seemed to really astound Axyl
and the locals.</FONT></FONT></P>

Axyl, who was completely forgetting the fact that Kingzing City was
just hit by a meteorite. Axyl soon focused on reality, other than
imagining Holly with no clothes on, as a mysterious splash of nacho
cheese hit the front of Holly's car. Axyl gasped, like a little girl,
as he watched Holly hesitate her driving and calmly pull over to the
side of the road. “Ugh, what?!” Holly yelled at the top of her
lungs, as she tried to get all the cheese off with her windshield
wipers. The cheese was steaming with heat and was too thick to be rid
of. No one else was in sight, except Axyl who had just pulled to the
side of the road behind her. As quickly as possible, Axyl had
transformed into Blue Lazer, which only consisted of a poor excuse
for a superhero costume. Thankfully, Holly did not notice Axyl had
parked a few hundred yards behind her, for she was too busy trying to
be rid of the nacho cheese. Holly watched the cheese ooze her
windshield and into the hood of her car. “Oh dammit!” More cheese
mysteriously poured onto her car, absolutely from nowhere. </FONT></FONT>

dressed very casually, wearing dark blue (and some dark red)

outside. The first thought that came to Blue Lazer's mind was the
FBI. Of course, the FBI would be here but that wasn’t the case. The
neighborhood had practically turned into a war zone. Citizens were
absolutely terrified. Some stayed in their homes and some were brave
enough to stay outside and record raw footage of the whole scenario.
Blue Lazer was the complete opposite of exhausted. He was willing to

of protecting innocent bystanders. Thank God no one was hurt. </FONT></FONT>

Bxir looked at him, then looked at Kriket, and scoffed in the most
casual way possible. The rest of the Asids were in a seemingly large
training room, partying it up like it was 1999. For the Asids, they
would find any possible way to enjoy the positive attributes of life.
They were in the middle of a war conflict, and this was the best they
could do for themselves to ease the insane amount of anxiety, stress,
and trauma. The Misara Serum was displayed on a hovering, metallic
podium and soldiers gazed at its majestic, curious appearance. A
simple object, containing less than a liter of dominating
destruction, just sitting there. It was exhilarating to be in the
presence of it and also extremely intimidating. No one even bothered
to touch it, because they knew of its powerful status. Preox and Rig
had successfully stolen the Serum, several years after Zjok had
betrayed his own kind. After stealing the dangerously awesome weapon
from the clutches of Zjok, on the planet Fleek, Preox and Rig
successfully delivered it back to the planet Strom. Planet Suzia
would be an obvious choice of storing the Serum in a safe location.
Planet Strom was empty, a lonesome area, and being almost completely
uninhabited, keeping the Serum there was most necessary. Weeks after
Preox and Rig’s outstanding victory, none of the Asids have heard
from the Adoa. As angry as Zjok became of his precious weapon being
stolen, he decided to give the Asids a silent treatment, a deadly
one, and Preox did not enjoy this silence one bit. Deep down in mind,
he knew that the Adoa could unexpectedly attack at any moment. This
celebration of victory caused him to become overly paranoid, even
though he was also sure that the Adoa could never find them on Strom.
Unfortunately, of all of Preox’s sureness, the Asids did not know
that they were being tracked down at this very moment. A simple war
tactic, and the Asids seemed to have completely overlooked it. </FONT></FONT>

ended their little discussion and Axyl proceeded to make his way to
Kingzing City High School. Today was wet and dreary, due to the
weather's most recent rainstorm.  Axyl was jammin' out to the radio,
just waiting for the traffic light to turn green. He looked at his
rear view mirror, adjusting the baseball cap he wears daily on his
head. Once he adjusted his hat to a more comfortable size, it was
already too late for him to notice a speeding vehicle headed toward
the rear of his truck. “Oh.” Axyl’s body jerked forward, once
the car slammed into the truck's tailgate, causing the airbag to
burst from his steering wheel. Axyl moaned in pain, but could feel
his body heal immediately. “W-what--?” The car behind him now had
a demolished hood, which was revealed as it backed up and began to
drive off. Axyl tore the airbag apart in total anger, as he watched
that damn car drive away. “The hell, man! Oh, no he didn't!”
Then, police sirens were heard from behind. Axyl turned his head and
watched police cars drive past. By the looks of it, the KCPD was in
pursuit of a heist. Axyl sighed at the top of his lungs in
frustration. This looked like a job for, ugh, Blue Lazer.</FONT></FONT></P>

nodded. He had to admit, he did miss the hell out of Kriket. Over the
past several years of his first war with Zjok and his Adoa Army,
Preox had become more angry and moody, along with becoming more
emotionally detached. He really needed to focus on what makes him
happy. Admiral Bxir was one-thousand percent right about no other
female falling for someone by the likes of Preox. Hell, Preox could
admit that himself. Whether Preox had a pole up his ass, or wanted to
play the serious game, no other Asid girl would be attracted to him.
Bxir’s harsh words made the Magnate realized how much of an ass, a
lucky ass at that, he was really becoming. However, for those who
knew Preox and his mode of portraying his personality, no one could
really blame him for always having a temper. Kriket was completely
devoted to Preox, like a desperate school girl, anxiously waiting for
him to turn his stupid fat head to her attention. After becoming
ultimately separated from each other, during the battle of the planet
Strom, Kriket had hoped for Preox’s safety more than her own. Preox
was paying too much attention to the war, not towards what made him
truly happy. In doing so, this was slowly turning Preox into a raging
war-monger. Kriket was not only concerned for Preox and his temper,
she also did not want him to go completely overboard, which was as
similar as Zjok’s story when he betrayed the Asids. What Kriket
really wanted to do for Preox was to just hold him closely and tell
him everything was going to be alright. Preox would agree, of course,
but there was more worry in him than everyone else.</FONT></FONT></P>

two best buddies had set up their rest areas, as The Storage was
looking more like an exotic rainforest. Preox, who camped next to
Zjok, took out his container full of water and faced his friend. “A
toast, my dear friend, to a new, amazing start.” Zjok smiled, and
clinked his water container next to Preox’s. “Cheers, buddy.”
They took only but a sip of their water and stored it in their
trapdoor and The Storage was not as empty as it was before. The
climate began to feel as real as ever, as was getting colder. All of
the Asids fully occupied, and the entire room was filled with wet
grass, trees, and dirt.</FONT></P>

front of a massive table with holo-graphic ships. There were two
teams of ships, both representing an opposing army, on either side.
There were also holo-graphic dots on the table, indicating
holo-graphic infantry. “Alright, Zjok,” said the Asid. “I am
Controller Claknibox and I welcome you to your first day in
commandment training. You will begin on Level Lamna, and you will be
competing against another young Asid, like yourself, who is also in
the other room next to us. You will know who your opponent is, until
the training is over. You will be commanding the opposing fleet, as
the other Asid will be commanding the other. For motivation, your
goal is to get your infantry past your half of the board, in order to

before he was going to think more negative thoughts, he saw opposing
“fighter ships” attacking Zjok’s holo-graphic fleet. Under the
surveillance of Claknibox, Zjok took the controls of “his fleet”
and began attacking blindly. Then, something sparked inside of Zjok’s
head. A spark which consisted all the anger, sadness, happiness, and
determination in his life. Zjok knew exactly what to do now. The
training session consisted of gaining points and the more points a
trainee would receive, the more “power-ups” the trainee would
get. Sort of like a video game. Zjok concentrated, sending in a
number of ships</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt"><I> </I></FONT><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt">to
drop off more infantry to keep the opponents from crossing Zjok’s

peculiar about Zjok’s silly behavior, after they had stumbled upon
Kriket. He didn’t let that bother him for too long, until about
three hours into his sleep duration. Preox slept in the same room as
Zjok, sleeping in luxurious and exotic cots, which was much better
than sleeping through environmental changes of The Storage. The two
Team Leaders kept their Vambits stored in their very own
high-security cabinet, which also contained their full suit of armor
and weapons. Although, the cabinets weren’t exactly sound proof.
The sound of an obnoxiously loud rock tune alarmed Preox from his
bunk, awakening immediately. This made Zjok wake up, as well. “What
the hell is that?” Zjok said weakly. He did not want to be woken
up. He rubbed his eyes and looked across the small room, watching
Preox slowly rise up from his cot.</FONT></P>

swiping his index finger in a crisscross motion. The rock music got
louder, once the cabinet had opened, causing Zjok to wrap his pillow
around his face. Preox set his Vambit on his bed and activated its
main controls. The rock music stopped, finally. A holo-graphic screen
appeared before Preox, as he set the Vambit on the front pedestal of
his cot and sat inside it. A small selection of holo-graphic buttons
was on the screen, asking whether to “answer the incoming call”
or “ignore.” Preox found it strange that it wasn’t Admiral Bxir
actually calling him, this time. Full of curiosity, Preox selected
“answer the incoming call.” It was Kriket. Her young face filled
the screen. Preox was surprised, gasping in shock, as he whispered,
“What?! Asid Kriket! What’re you doing?! You’re not supposed to

than just an illusion. He made it to the surface of Suzia, landing on
the fresh blue grass. He was surprised that he did not see any Asid
guards patrolling the area. Why weren’t there any? This was all too
mysterious and unnatural! On top of that mysterious and unnatural
atmosphere, it was silent. Too silent. He stretched his armor-plated
arm, and a rifle unfolded itself from the armor. Zjok held the weapon

herrrrreee,” the voice said again. Swirling amounts of red smoke
started rising from the blue grass. Zjok pointed his rifle where the
smoke was coming from and before he knew it, the red smoke formed an
over-sized figure. It did not look like an Asid, nor did it look like
it was any creature he had ever seen. It was at least twelve feet
tall and it left Zjok speechless. The figure appeared harmless, yet
intimidating. “I am the last of the Drokensmur.”</FONT></P>

years before the first Asid was born. The Drokensmur were known for
using telepathic abilities and evaporating themselves to avoid threat

apartment, Holly Ransfield was making a few finishing touches with
her makeup and hair. She stared at herself in a mirror, whilst
standing in her messy room. She wore a typical jacket and denim
jeans. Then, she began to talk to herself, out of pure anxiety.
“Alright, please don’t look fat. This is Axyl Smithy that you’re
going out with, tonight. I know that makes my eye twitch, but what he
did was unforgettable and awesome. Remember that, Holly, REMEMBER

seemed to be alone in her house, due to the awkward silence, after
she had yelled at herself in the mirror. She looked beautiful, her
hair was carefully curled, and her lips were glistening with gloss.
She sighed with distress. She had never felt so nervous before in her
entire life. She had never been on a date before, either. She sighed
deeply as she often wished that she never reserved the date in the
first place, especially at the critically-acclaimed restaurant known
as </FONT><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt"><I>The Dookoran.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt">

started ringing. It was Kyle. Axyl drove out of the garage and

to blush, and he felt like a sissy. Just months ago, he was a
heartless dirt bag, and now he was practically ill of anxiety from
taking a gorgeous girl out on a date. He felt as though he needed to
punch flowers, in order to become a man again. Axyl looked closely at
the small house, for he couldn’t tell if anyone truly lived there,
or not. It was quiet and it looked like it was not inhabited (Axyl
wouldn’t be surprised if Holly was playing a trick on him,
anyway.). He pulled up on the driveway, took out the ignition, and
exited the vehicle. The weather outside was absolutely fascinating,
calm and windless. </FONT>

Axyl had a feeling that he would get laid tonight, just like every
other “date” he had been on. Although, Holly was different, much
different than any other girl Axyl had slept with. He enjoyed her
company and he didn’t want to ruin any of what he and Holly had,

Axyl was widely impressed, for he had never been to a play before.
“Wow, it’s like a theater or something but for real.” The
audience started to grow and with only five minutes before the play

through the play program, which revealed the drama students’ role
in the production. </FONT>

school crush, Axyl wanted to get in a mutual fight. He, basically,
was so happy that he could punch someone in the face. Axyl was
slightly startled when the lights in the theatre came to a dim, for
the play was about to begin, followed by a giddy middle-aged man

not only beating the Mazers to a pulp, but brutally slaying them. The
Mazers had to be taken down, especially since they threatened to kill
many innocent people, including Cale Omnous. Blue Lazer wanted to cry
for the loss of his best friend. Instead of crying, he yelled
furiously, as he blasted a laser through a Mazer’s chest. </FONT>

obviously crushed into pieces. “Well thought I would try it out.”

Kyle walked off, he took out his cellphone and frantically dialed
Velouria’s number, just praying that she was okay. Blue Lazer and
Evil Nacho followed, as they began to head toward Velouria’s
neighborhood, which was nearby the supermarket. Flying seemed more
appropriate, but being detected by more Adoa was the last thing to
achieve.  Blue Lazer remained quiet and he really needed to. He
didn’t mean to constantly think about himself and only himself. He
was just too stupid to realize it. In conclusion, he couldn’t be
more grateful to be around Holly. If it weren’t for her, Blue Lazer
would never realize how much an incompetent ape he really was.</FONT></P>

To Blue Lazer’s amazement, Galg seemed to be a lot stronger than
the rest of the Mazers, including the Strikers. Galg’s fireball
cannon was automatic, shooting fireballs at anyone who was
surrounding the two. No one could jump in and help. Galg squeezed
onto Blue Lazer’s fist, tightly, the pressure from his fingers were
enormous. It actually started to cause pain, Blue Lazer beginning to
groan. “Ouch, dude, stop!” </FONT>

armor,” Galg simply stated. “Courtesy of Zjok, himself. Made for
combat especially like this. Now, Axyl, consider your last moment
come to an end.” Before Blue Lazer could fire a laser in his face,
Galg held on onto him tightly, firing many rounds into his stomach.
Blue Lazer couldn’t get free, Galg was way too strong. The fireball
cannon kept everyone under heavy fire, as Galg continued to fire his
rifle into Blue Lazer’s stomach. Blood was spilling everywhere and
Blue Lazer was screaming in agony. He shut his eyes tight, just
wishing and hoping the pain would end.  Was this the end of Blue
Lazer?</FONT></P>

hard. The thorns dug into Galg’s sensitive skin and blood began to
slowly ooze. From a nonchalant expression to a deeply angry one,
Holly’s face was full of the following expressions, she tightened
the grip on Galg’s throat. Everyone surrounding them all watched in

scream or say any last words, as his face had disintegrated into
nothing. Galg’s head was completely burnt off, with flames erupting
from where it once was. Galg’s utterly brutal death was thus ended

outside. A couple of the battleships were already destroyed, slowly
sinking into the Pacific Ocean. It was only a matter of time before
the Adoa ships could actually reach the carrier and started attacking
it, as well. Followed by the one and only Asid ship, as piloted by

the ocean. After his body had twitched and jerked for a few seconds,
from the electricity, Blue Lazer opened his eyes. He could see a
sunken battleship, along with sunken Adoa ships, deep inside the
water. He could see dead bodies, broken machinery, and all sorts of
other broken things. Deep inside his thoughts, Blue Lazer was feeling
absolute remorse for those who have fallen against the Adoa;
especially for his best friend Cale, who had perished under the same
hands. However, Blue Lazer found it acceptable to not let all of the
emotional trauma consume his mind. He felt his body completely heal
from the heavy damage, and began to swim back to the surface of the

was drawing near. He unleashed a muffled, underwater scream and
blasted the shark with his elbow laser. The shark died instantly,
with blood flowing from its gaping laser wound. Blue Lazer gasped for
air, once he reached the surface of the Pacific Ocean. Everything was
loud and abrupt from the constant battle. Blue Lazer took notice that

Blue Lazer the idea he had never thought he would come close to

room. There were several engines on the floor, ceiling, and both
sides of the room, causing Blue Lazer to literally move all over the

The cool breeze rushed through the shattered and broken windows and
it was disturbingly quiet. There were a few occurrences of distant

took what they could (that being a lead pipe and a rock) and they
proceeded out of the building, as quiet as they could be. They made
it to the street in front of the bank, seeing that their surroundings
were in ruins. Some buildings were either collapsed to the ground, or
just about as damaged as the bank itself. Vehicles found were
crucially destroyed and in flames. A crashed military jet, completely
on fire, was even seen lodged inside a nearby building. Those who
were inexperienced with warfare, and aliens from outer space, were
completely stunned and fearful once they saw the destruction of
Kingzing City. It was depressing, shocking, and it felt so unreal.
However, their feelings were ultimately liberated after seeing some
buildings which remained illuminated with the night sky. They could
also see the beautiful night sky, filled with bright stars. It was a

it being much closer. The sound of falling trees echoed throughout

bark cracking and breaking. Blue Lazer took a deep breath, after

all of the buildings around her were diminished to the ground. It was
a rather disturbing setting to be a part of, especially since it was
pretty much all of Holly’s fault. Like before, she wanted to cry
again. However, with her motivation to destroy the enemy, she would
rather bleed than shed one more tear. Ever since Agent Nathan12,
along with several other marines, had died Holly just snapped, which

radius big enough to send Blue Lazer straight into a house. After

local neighborhood (The neighborhood of which Kyle lived in. Some

of plasma. One blob of plasma hit the vehicle he was holding,
blasting him away. With the vehicle completely destroyed, Blue Lazer

armor. The Neeka screamed angrily, firing a few plasma bursts at a
house, right next to them. The house exploded, where the force of the
explosion sent Blue Lazer flying involuntarily, once more. The Neeka
grabbed him and slammed him hard against the street. The sudden pain

lava, rolled back up onto his feet before the Neeka could shoot him

was just about to stomp her face in, with is heavy-armored boot,
until the sudden force of Axyl knocked him on the ground. They
wrestled around the cockpit, punching each other like politicians. As
Axyl remembered the time he was in Varsity wrestling in sophomore
year, long before he got into baseball, he remembered of a fantastic
wrestling move he had learned from Coach Sleeve. Before Coach Sleeve
had hated Axyl for screwing up his final chance at the district
baseball game, he had taught Axyl of a fantastic wrestling move,
which resulted in a deadly chokehold. Axyl was doing great with the
wrestling, but he didn’t remember the exact move. This actually
resulted Zjok in punching Axyl in the face hard enough to knock him
off. Axyl fell backward and immediately attempted to get back up and
fight. </FONT>

Without giving Axyl the chance to get up on his feet, let alone his
body to heal, Zjok pointed his weapon at him, and shot the massive
needle into the center of his chest. He could feel his bones
breaking, as the needle intruded his body. Axyl gasped for air, as he
could feel the Serum fight to recover his body from such horrific
pain. The needle was sucking the Serum into the massive vile. All
while that was happening, the needle was also sucking out all of
Axyl’s own blood, evaporating it into the air. Axyl was getting
weaker and weaker, as his powers were ultimately stolen by Zjok. He
couldn’t get the needle out of his chest, nor could he fire lasers,
fly, or even move. </FONT>

she could, as beautiful flowers started to sprout from areas along
her arms and in her hair. For some reason, and that reason being the

heads perked up, confused from what Preox had said. He continued,
taking notice of everyone’s attention span. “After being told
that Zjok had ultimately exploded into pieces, after injecting an
amount of the Misara Serum, he didn’t realize that he performed
unrighteous acts against the Drokensmur. For those of you who don’t
know what a Drokensmur is: Drokensmur are a rare (almost extinct)
species that can obtain unnatural powers beyond imagination. When
they are about to die, they grant their special abilities to those
who seem worthy of obtaining. The last Drokensmur to ever exist, or
so we think, visited Zjok on the brink of its death. Zjok was always
a disturbed Asid, but the Drokensmur saw what Zjok was capable of.
The Drokensmur’s dying wish was to grant Zjok his powers to use it
for the greatness and protection of his kind. According to this
‘Dying Wish,’ if Zjok were to do the complete opposite, let alone
misinterpret what the Drokensmur had intended, Zjok himself would
receive dire consequences.” 	</FONT></P>

height. She looked so cute in her blue graduation gown. “My name is
Velouria Lancelot and as far as some know, I usually go by ‘Vel’

an accomplishment, an accomplishment we’ve been waiting for since
we started kindergarten. There are so many wonderful, familiar faces
I see in the audience; faces I’ve been seeing since I was the age

many of you may know: there was an attack over a month ago and
Kingzing City ended up in a heap of danger, along with many of its
inhabitants. I, myself, along with my three best friends, and many
other brave souls partook in fighting back, against a force which
threatened the human race’s way of life. Fortunately, we succeeded!
Unfortunately, we’ve lost plenty. I pray for those who were lost on
that day and for those who are still in mourn, including me and my
friends. I’ve learned a lot this year, especially after the
invasion of Kingzing City. I’ve learned that no matter how hopeless
a situation can be, all you’ve got to do is keep your loved ones
close to you. Enjoy every second with them. Keep those people close.”
Velouria took a slight glance at Kyle, and smiled at him gently. “I
would like to thank my parents, my family, my teachers, and my peers
for keeping me up on my toes in whatever direction I was headed,
whether it was bad or good. I would also like to thank all of the
brave souls who fought valiantly ing last month. You guys will always

hissing like a bunch of rattlesnakes. Even a few students had maracas
to portray a rattlesnake’s tail. Velouria immediately received her
high school diploma, once she had stepped down to sit next to her
friends. It was now Kyle’s turn to give his speech. He stood before
the audience, holding no notecards, placing his hands on either side
of the podium and gave everyone a huge smile. “HI! Hello, everyone!
Allow me to introduce myself! I’m Kyle Manning and I am more than
happy to be speaking in front of all you lovely people, tonight. I
can’t believe it myself, we’re actually graduating! Look at us,
all grown up, determined to create the future we’ve always dreamed
of. We’ve all known each other, seen each other, for over ten
years. It breaks my heart that I’m not going to see much of you
guys, anymore, especially the ones who were responsible for calling
me names. Names such as ‘Pencil,’ ‘Skinny Boy,’ or just
‘Shit-Face.’ Oh, yeah, I’ll miss those people sooo entirely. I
digress! Much has changed for me, since these past three months. I’ve
faced new challenges, I’ve killed aliens from outer space, and I’ve
made new friends. Friends I’ve never thought I would even have the
pleasure to give a proper greeting. Of all that’s happened, I too
have learned a valuable lesson: Never back down. Great, now I have
that Tom Petty song stuck in my head!” </FONT>

entire audience laughed at Kyle’s ridiculously corny remark. He
laughed softly into the mic, smiling his biggest smile yet. “When I
first started high school, I had a hard time expressing who I really
was. I’ve found it difficult to say the right things around others
and I always worried what they would think of me if I did anything.
No one should ever worry about the way he or she is! Thanks to my
most recent experiences, such as fighting for my life, as well as for
others, I’ve learned that standing up for yourself for something
that you could change is all worth taking any risk. Even if it seems
to be a preposterous notion. And if something gets in the way, just
knock it down! Plus, be sure to never lose, or forget, who you really
are and what you’re standing up for. As individuals, we are all
powerful and there is no ‘weakest link.’ Be proud of who you are
and don’t feel obligated to impress one another. Speak for
yourself, respect yourself, just </FONT><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt"><I>be

think about this now and I regret every single taunt, every punch,

which was completely unnecessary. After becoming Blue Lazer, I was
too naïve to believe that life as a superhero would be fun and
adventurous, just like in the comic books. I realized that life is
not all about fun and games, like the moment when I first got shot in

nodded. “Yeah, that was me, I killed that thing. No big deal, or
anything! Anyway, this is completely irrelevant to what I have to say
here. If it weren’t for being Blue Lazer, after getting know people
who have actually despised me in the past, after saving many lives
from terrifying fates, I would never had noticed how much of pompous
turd I was. My dad, Jared Smithy, also helped me realize that. My dad
has done nothing but stand by and made sure I learned the basics
about life and what will be thrown at you, once you enter the real
world. Being a wealthy father, who had enough money to pay for my
car, my phone bills, and my education, he made me get a job. At
first, I whined like a little kid, but then I started getting paid.
After a few months of working there, I’ve realized that doing hard
labor and helping others actually felt good. Once Blue Lazer came
into view, I realized, ‘Hey, I’m helping others, right now,
regardless if I’m working or not,’ and it felt really good. Then
I thought, ‘Why live a life, where everyone hates you and despises
your well-being because you’re such an ass to them?’ Having my
eyes completely open now, I’m really thankful that I turned out
this way, the way that I am now. What’s more is that I gained new
friends, friends who also respect me, and I can’t be more thankful
than that. I truly mean that.” Axyl could feel himself tearing up a
little, but fought it back by giving a normal smile, rather than just
a goofy grin, towards the audience. </FONT>

from her chair and proceeded to the podium, without saying a word.
The audience’s cheers, chants, and claps had finally ceased, once
she faced everyone. From Axyl’s ridiculously sweet speech, Holly

Longview, Washington. Commander Moosey also hired Mr. Flower as an

Flower has become formally known as Agent Flower14. Mr. Flower now

perfectly decorated with special badges and emblems. Badges for
bravery, persistence, and even keeping a positive and keen attitude!
The seven-foot tall moose now sat behind a crescent-shaped desk,
which was where he focused on his career the most. There was a giant,
framed illustration of him, Commander Derno, Agent Nathan12, and many
of his other friends on his back wall. Friends such as Axyl, Preox,
Rig, Holly, etc. One object was for certain to piss off Preox, which
was taken place in Moosey’s big, nature decorative office: Below
the framed illustration was an Adoa Mazer’s rifle. The gun was
taken care of, clean, and much larger than the average-sized human
rifle. It was a rifle Moosey had stolen, while he was in combat.
Moosey had also kept two cartridges of ammo in the bottom right
drawer of his desk, in case of a severe emergency. Preox knew none of
this, but Moosey knew he would be in trouble if he did. </FONT>

the snowman’s neck and ripped his head off, clean. Blue Lazer,
having obtaining yet another unique ability, formed another blue fire
ball and blasted away the last snowman. The monster exploded into
nothing but steam. The entire apartment was a mess of snow, slush,
and cold water. Jared’s moans of distress came from the bathroom. </FONT>

amount of snowmen, a few earthquakes had occurred and were immdiately
taken notice of. The ferocious, super-powered couple gazed around at
their surroudnings, as the small earthquakes continued. The
earthquakes seemed to be unnatural and less aggressive than actual
earthquakes. It was as though there was something massive headed
their way. </FONT>

thirty-foot robotic snowman wandered from around the corner, shooting
tremendous amounts of snow into the air for the other snowmen to
spawn from the ground. A psychotic, crazy man operated this giant and
could be seen from atop of the robot itself. The man laughed like
crazy, as his army of snowman rose from the ground like relentless
zombies. </FONT>
