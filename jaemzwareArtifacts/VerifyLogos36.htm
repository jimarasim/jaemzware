happiness and success. Discover how to raise it, so you can finally
start living from the vibration of Love or Above.</td></tr><tr><td>We ♥ your privacy.</td></tr><tr><td>Ever noticed how some uncannily ‘lucky’ people can almost effortlessly attract good things into their lives? At work, they get all the opportunities. They lead social movements in their communities. They’re spiritual, yet also have a healthy
relationship with money. Their relationships are consistently blissful, and they’re always in the pink of health.</td></tr><tr><td>But if you’re like most people, life is a mixture of good days and bad days. You may not be poor or sick, but you worry about your money and health a little more often than you’d like. You long for the time and freedom to live life on your own terms. You wish you were better at manifesting your goals.</td></tr><tr><td>And so you’ve probably wondered to yourself on more than a few occasions, “what does it take to be one of those lucky people?”</td></tr><tr><td>The answer lies in a fascinating phenomenon known as your personal energetic frequency</td></tr><tr><td>The idea that energy or vibrations can influence a person’s reality is nothing new. Throughout history, different cultures have benefitted by tapping into and working with different forms of energy. For thousands of years, the Chinese have practiced Qi Gong and Tai Chi to get their energy moving for health and relaxation.</td></tr><tr><td>In India, people have sought after Kundalini energy and awakened it for self-awareness, a deeper
understanding of consciousness and the Universe, and pure joy, knowledge, and love.</td></tr><tr><td>In Japan, Reiki has healed countless people simply by working with their personal energy fields.</td></tr><tr><td>But in recent years, breakthrough scientific studies have taken this belief one step further, by
discovering that every person on the planet possesses what is known as a personal energetic frequency—a form of energy that dictates what kind of circumstances and events we will attract into our lives.</td></tr><tr><td>CHRISTIE MARIE SHELDON</td></tr><tr><td>Founder of Love or Above</td></tr><tr><td>Christie Sheldon is an Intuitive Healer and Medium. She connects to the Infinite realm to shift, change, and transform people’s lives. She has worked with over 20,000 Clients and demonstrates these talents on the Radio and in Seminars.</td></tr><tr><td>Just like how seismographs are used to measure earthquakes, recent breakthroughs have
allowed researchers to measure a person’s energetic frequency on
a specific Vibrations Scale.</td></tr><tr><td>How does the scale work? Well imagine you have a scale of 1 to 1,000, with 1,000
being the highest state a human being can attain. If you reach this level you would
be an Enlightened Master. At the lowest end of the spectrum is someone who
is not thriving at all.</td></tr><tr><td>Researchers use muscle testing and kinesiology to determine where people are
on this scale. As you can see, heavy emotions like sadness, guilt or humiliation
vibrate at low frequencies, while feelings like love, bliss and enlightenment
vibrate at high, uplifting frequencies.</td></tr><tr><td>Right now, the average level of energy on Earth is around 207 —and this is because throughout our lives, we accumulate hidden energy blockages and negative conditioning that holds us back from higher vibrations.</td></tr><tr><td>The level we should aim for, however, is 500 and above. 500 is the vibration of love. When you vibrate at this level life becomes drastically different. Love, joy, and abundance are suddenly within your grasp. Pain, stress, and struggle seem to melt away and you become a magnet for what you truly desire.</td></tr><tr><td>But here’s where things get even better. Studies have shown that your energy doesn’t just affect you, but those around you too. Just Google research articles on subjects like the Maharishi affect or distance healing.</td></tr><tr><td>The conclusion? Everyone looking for a happier, more successful and more enlightened life should aim to overcome their energy blockages, and raise their energetic frequency to a level of Love or Above—a theory that many other reputable scientists have since come to support.</td></tr><tr><td>At the Mind Science Foundation in San Antonio, Dr. William Braud found that his test subjects could slow down the death rate of red blood cells with the sheer power of their thoughts. The implications were staggering, proving that it’s possible to use your mind to influence your body and the things around you.</td></tr><tr><td>Dr. Masaru Emoto projected different types of thoughts onto glasses of water, froze them, and examined the resulting water
crystals under a microscope. What he found was that water crystals infused with higher vibrational thoughts like “love” or “joy” formed beautiful patters, while those with negative thoughts like “hate” or “anger” were rough, opaque and in a state of chaos. Now think about this: since 75 percent of your body is water, how could your thoughts be influencing it?</td></tr><tr><td>Christie Marie Sheldon is an Intuitive Healer and Medium who specializes in raising people’s personal vibrations to a level of Love or Above. Her gift is being able to look at a person and instantly detect blockages in their energetic wellbeing, which could be the result of negative programming or past experiences.</td></tr><tr><td>Christie removes these blockages through a variety of mental and spiritual exercises known as energetic tools. They’re powerful, enjoyable, and so easy to use that they can even be practiced from the comfort of your home.</td></tr><tr><td>In the past 15 years, over 20,000 people have sought Christie’s help.

I don’t usually remember my dreams very well, but this one stayed clear in my mind. I dreamed that I met a crow and somehow became roommates with that crow. Like, it wasn’t like a pet, we both had our own lives and did our own thing, we just lived in the same room. We treated each other pretty much as I would treat any friend, though she didn’t really ‘speak’, she vocalized as any normal crow would (though not in the loud ‘caw’s you would normally hear, but in a quieter, softer tone they typically use for family). After some time, she made a nest and suddenly there were three fledglings. But not long after that, she fell ill. I took her to a vet, but they couldn’t do anything to help her. We said out good-byes and she made me promise to look after her children. I didn’t want to leave her, so I held her until she succumbed to her illness. I went to her children to tell them what had happened and that I would be taking care of them now. They seemed sad, but okay with it. Not long after that, I woke up, still feeling the pain of loss.</td></tr><tr><td>Would this be a dream of a spirit animal? Does it have any meaning? Am I supposed to do something? I don’t know much about spirit animals and I mostly just assumed it was a dream born from my love of crows and all the research I had been doing on them. Though, it’s a little unusual I would have a dream like that, since I normally hate that sort of narrative (and there were no dragons, most of my dreams involve dragons). I just don’t know.</td></tr><tr><td>As a side note, I took the test and it said my spirit animal is the owl. It also said I may also be connected with the crow and/or the snake. Interestingly, I’ve always had an obsession with snakes ever since I was a child, and owls are my second favorite birds, after crows. Not sure if that means anything.</td></tr><tr><td>Ok I’ve been having weird things happen to me! And I want to ask some experts (you guys!), what is going on with me? I went to the zoo recently, and me and my family went to the Wolf part of the zoo and the people who work there told us that they had only 2 wolves. Which we saw the 2 relaxing by each other in the sun, but for some weird reason I saw a 3rd wolf! I asked my mom “do you see that wolf in the shade sitting there?” My mom looked at me weirdly. She thought I was crazy, because she didn’t see it and I even pointed where it was, and the rest of my family said I was crazy. I was so mad! Then again at the zoo I was waiting for my younger sister and brother to get out of the bathroom,I realized that the same wolf was standing beside me! I reached out and touched it. My dad asked what I was doing and I told him “petting the wolf!” He told me there was no wolf, and I said yeah there is! The wolf was very kind, it seemed like it wanted me to follow it so I followed it when I was bored. It lead me to an old tree. I was confused, why did it lead me there?</td></tr><tr><td>spirit animals are mysterious. they can only be seen by you and you only. i don’t fully understand why spirit animals do what they do</td></tr><tr><td>Ok! Thank you! I wanted somebody’s opinion on it, and they are mysterious! Thanks again!</td></tr><tr><td>Me and my cousin Ben are wildly related to wolfs and it sounds like this wolf was a spirit send to bring you good look the tree is related to commitment and strength and is there to show you your true path, have you been offered a life changing opertunity then you should take it with open arms as that is your true destiny</td></tr><tr><td>The only reason sprit animals are so mysterious is because if you see a animal and others don’t that means that animal is you spirit animal</td></tr><tr><td>In your quiz I get OWL. But I feel that my spirit animal is FOX.
When I was younger I was afraid of foxes because of rabies and now I simply adore them.
I don’t know why, but suddenly I was really beginning to attract to foxes. They are beautiful and special.</td></tr><tr><td>Same for me with Wolves! I feared them now I can’t resists saying ‘Aw’ to it! I feel mine is a wolf, but I agree with you. Foxes are adorable!</td></tr><tr><td>It is very useful to my study</td></tr><tr><td>[…] is getting mystical this summer as it will be selling spirit animal straws to go along with your […]</td></tr><tr><td>I’ve taken several of quizzes and I always get an Owl. I’ve read some articles here in this website. I have this feeling that it’s impossible for me to have an owl as my spirit animal…Owls are cool but I’m not that intelligent for them to choose me. I’ve been thinking since I read on how to find my spirit animal. I’ve never seen an owl in my entire life. Owls have big eyes and I have this Jack Skellington doll and he has big black eyes and I have watched the movie “big eyes” and I have watched the korean telenovela “The Heirs” where there is an owl doll and when I went to a furniture shop I saw owl designed candle holders, now that I think of it, maybe those are symbols? Is it calling me?</td></tr><tr><td>The owl , you may not be the smartest but you shall become if you follow the owls saying, intelligence is not smartness but to make the correct choices you are doing fine do not let people tell you otherwise you was chosen for a reason</td></tr><tr><td>I am a pack leader forever. The wolf has chosen me. I have howled in the night and they responded it was amazing they chose me.</td></tr><tr><td>As a beta I have seen the wolfs and my Alfa Ben has lived with them and grown and adapted to their abilities he has told me story’s of how wolfs reply back to people it is a good look charm it a message that you are a pack leader the wolfs may accept you but to be a true leader you must be willing to die and make choices for your pack, can you do that once you accept your fair the wolfs will exempt you! Be strong and follow your spirit and joy and happiness will come to you!</td></tr><tr><td>Every time I close my eye’s and ask for my spirit animal I always get the image of a rabbit.
