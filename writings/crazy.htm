<i>you've been served</i><br />
DK, DE, CP, JJ,
[cc all]
<br />
<br />
you have all falsely accused me of being crazy this year, or in the past. for no reason other than jealousy, envy, and losing arguments with me.<br />
<br />
in turn, i become angry over your false accusations, and naturally become emotionally stressed, damaged, and physically lose gray-matter because you don't let up until i've hit rock bottom.<br />
<br />
"we waited for you to hit rock bottom because you were crazy." <br />
<br />
false: you waited for me to hit rock bottom because i would not cave to your manipulation.<br />
<br />
this causes me to lash at you; that is why i lash out at you; that is why i'm mean. it is self-defense, though not a very good one from experience. i'll continue to evolve and tackle
my demons. as you should too.<br />
<br />
next, you feign helping build my life back and forgiving me on paper, but then repeat the process once i've regained my emotional balance, integrity, and success beyond what you've<br /> experienced in life ... to impress mom and dad and win the race against reclaiming the pine lake house and a stake in dad's wealth, that i don't give two shits about. dad taught me how to fish and i'm sorry you didn't listen to him closer.<br />
<br />
C, D and D, compound with your argumentative losses to me you have a lot of inner jealousy and typical sibling rivalry. for a long time you have been pining for mom and dad's<br /> attention. when i moved home from boise/hp following my first attempted suicide in the year 2000, i took that attention back, and was jokingly referred to as the "prodigal son" by D.  on paper<br /> it was in jest, inside D has deep-rooted hate towards me since being born a son, following C and D who had already taken a large chunk of his first-born,<br /> only-kid kind of attention; a male entitled child that was expected to be the head of the family should something cause our father to leave the home. until i unexpectedly, by all, including mom & dad, came along.<br />
<br />
when i take any attention away from you, you plot against me.  since i was born.<br />
<br />
my recent success at work, in business and in my personal life is the reason for your latest harassments in person (or absence, D), over text and over email.<br />
<br />
J you have deep-rooted childhood traumatic anger at me, unfairly because i was forced out of my own, very first purchased home in the year 2000, following my first attempted suicide, to by your mother, claire, who was causing extreme emotional damage that led to that suicide attempt. <br />
<br />in leaving, J, your mother doubly guised me as a deadbeat father who didn't love you, and restricted my communication with you very frequently, for up to 2 years during your formative years. i'm not sure what she did on paper in your home, but i suspect she didn't speak well of me, and subversively incepted ideas that i was indeed crazy, and she already had a brand new abusive step-father to baby trap with riley, while collecting my thousand a month child support check for her beer fund.<br />
<br />
J, you have grown obsessively close to my sister C recently, and behave just as suspicious as her, D, and D.  you also do not contact me nor give me the time of day anymore. your dad, who helped you move to seattle in the first place. i wholeheartedly regret doing that. you easily pulled my heart strings to do it. it's all you've known since you were 6. and both the axtman and arasim families have used that against me, over and over for 27 years.<br />
<br />
J, all this aside, you obsess over satanism and the occult.  and your only good friends live in idaho.  that did not come from me. i'm catholic and have all sacraments but marriage and last rights.  and i intend to get married to katie or become father jim with an unironic vow of celibacy.<br />
<br />
J, i would like a paternity test.<br />
<br />
all of you. please discuss this with your therapists. i did. i am in treatment. i have been in treatment since 2016 and not drinking alcohol; whereas, you are all alcoholics. and J, you are into all sorts of drugs.<br />
<br />
all of you, please be careful with all of our lives.  there is not much time left for anyone on this planet.  make good use of it, or consider the balance of good and evil in your mind, and keep in mind that too much of either does not bode <b>anyone</b> well on <b><i>this</i></b> planet & time span.<br />
<br />
i would suggest a dual diagnosis program, for all of you. and https://al-anon.org/ for any of your loved ones who are currently expressing the exact same concerns as i about your recent behavior towards them when you are under the influence of alcohol (knowingly or not).<br />
<a href="https://al-anon.org" target="_blank">al-anon</a><br />
<br />
if you are not currently seeking therapy and psychiatry, you should ask yourself why, and then consider the damage you've done to me.<br />
<br />
you all have the same blood as me, though J is questionable. i suspect he may be D's son. though, the signs are blatant in J's constant outbursts of depression and suicidal ideation on facebook.<br />
<br />
there is bad dna in the o'connor blood that affected myself, mom & uncle tom; likewise it does for all of you.  J could be unrelated, and just plain childhood trauma from neglect and mental abuse from his mother.  D, you have had and are having manic episodes now.<br />
<br />
navos inpatient/outpatient takes applecare / medicaid; otherwise i recommend harborview and fairfax in juanita. flying to denmark and going crazy and/or seeking treatment there, would be my best advice.<br />
<br />
our healthcare system is corrupt as our government, and you all know that... very well.  i suspect you use it against me. i know this 100%.  and i'm working on proving it with a dossier on each for all of you.  in 2006 i was hauled off by two fake police officers to a staged hospital in northgate. the horror i experienced in your little setup haunts me the most to this day.<br />
<br />
i was strapped to a gurney with an east indian woman sitting next to me.<br />
<br />
at the time i had an east indian manager whose arrogant racism and nepotism was causing me to lose it in the workplace, at Microsoft, where C worked with me and my then-friend tom.  tom knew my struggle well, but would always dodge discussing it with me to vent.<br />
<br />
the east indian woman assured me that nothing was wrong.<br />
<br />
in the room behind me, behind the wall, i heard the loud screams of my ex-wife claire being brutally gang raped by omlb (not fancypants), and having her pinky finger cut off like my own. her screams sounded real and extremely horrific. i still do not know to this day if that part was staged. but what i heard was real. the loudest voice i heard was tom as the ring leader of omlb; shouting and laughing in his high-pitched, unmistakeable, little-bitch, arrogant, greedy-ass bragging voice of assumed power and entitlement of a rich dentist-daddy's son in any situation.  johnny was there too; the man who threatened to chase me down and shoot me in the face while enroute to copenhagen, denmark, when that triggered heavy ptsd that i had to be hospitalized for there.<br />
<br />
i don't have auditory hallucinations as claire would have you think. i'm  delusional from emotional stress caused by all of you, since i was born, and my mind starts thinking it can telepathy. shit man, stranger things have happened; as one kid said, "how do you know you're not telepathetic?"<br />
<br />
recently i've come across information that you have all been hiding a lot from me. and directly/indirectly forced me into jail sentences and hospitalizations in 2004, 2006, 2009, and<br /> 2015/2016.<br />
<br />
this is having me second-guess my diagnosis of bipolar type 1 psychotic features.  i just have ptsd like mom did, when chuck cheated on her with her best friend... and she had to find out<br /> the hard way.<br />
<br />
mom hasn't had an episode since, as would i have not, had i stayed away from seattle and reclaimed success at microsoft, or just all of you, in 2001.  you are all very good at faking love<br /> and care. you may say "live laugh love," but realistically do none of those. your motivations stem from greed.<br />
<br />
'greed is the root of all evil today.'<br />
<br />
if anything i've experienced with the side-effect of psychotic features was real. you're all fucked. light girl is not a joke, and i never intended her to be a joke or ficticious, at all.<br />  shit will go south for you fast if you don't get your balance right, like i've had mine since 2019.<br />
<br />
we're all born with sin like we were taught. life is about what we do with it.  i'm tackled my demon of greed before all of you, long ago. now lust won't stop teaching me lessons. i've recently decided to be a priest, call me father jim like chuck did (not our chuck, mom's other friend chuck. he was smart af. his inception worked.).
<br />
a good read for how you are affecting me now, like it did in 2004, 2006, 2009, and 2015<br />

<br />
none of you are welcome in my home. please do not call mom to invite yourself over, nor accept an invite from mom herself. i've tell her the same. and katie and i are moving in large part to be further away from you.<br />
<br />
feel free to contact me once you've obtained your 1-year aa coin, and we can discuss your denial about this very document, and consequences that will surely stem from that, but not from me.<br />
<br />
do not contact me or speak through mom and dad. let me live my own life and evolve.
<br />
Sincerely,<br />
Dumb Jim<br />

thought for the day:<br />
if the pen is mightier than the sword, what is a private cloud server where static pages like this can appear, disappear,reappear, get copied, be password protected by <a href="https://stuffedanimalwar.com target="_blank">stuffed animal war"</a>? ... hosted without censorship by your cronies in social media? it's mighty too, until the power goes out.<br />
