<span>Dear Ashley Abildgaard,the Talarico’s waitress / Red Lion Hostess,No, I do not want to watch COPS from my hospital bed again tonight.My head still hertz from the Angry Orchard you served me the other night at Talarico’s.Fuck your Wilson Wannabe Wigger friend.I’ll never eat there again.Although I am still willing to sit and smoke at Blonde Emma’s Velvety Foam Cafe, and Maybe some pie ala mode later, but only with you, Ashley Abildgaard.I can’t believe it’s been 12 years (2004-2016) since we split at that Red Lion Inn in Spokane Washington.  My how time flies.That must be the significance of the 12 pointed ring I threw at Kat to save her from Satan’s grip that one night several moons ago.She must be doing ok as I haven’t heard from her.Hopefully she found some new friends and a home to live in, instead of heroin needle el corazon dirty wet tent parties on the side of interstate 5 south.fuck that venue.offramps in seattle should never be closed.and you can take that tip as well, arboretu</span><br />

My only shit in the place was just some of my shit, and I didn’t wanna be a whiny American crying about being locked out of my spot.  That has not fared well for me in the past, even at home, unfortunately.Especially when it’s really really easy to be homeless in Copenhagen.The streets are safe as fuck.

I accidentally forgot to get comprehensive and collision, and the lender wells fargo repossessed my car.  My car had personal belongings in it. When i went to get it at the tow yard, it still had clothes, cds, my phone, and a whole key chain in it, that i could not find.  while working on logistics to get my car back, which you were very reluctant to help out with, they took my car before i left the tow yard. Essentially my car was stolen by wells fargo bank, and you did nothing to stop them.  Do I have to be a Government Employee to get decent full coverage insurance from Progressive?

<span>I don’t read. I’d rather my own ideas most of the time, so only out of necessity. Research.Even then I try to out hipster myself.  I like new trails.  And I love learning about the old ones from my friends.Everyone has their thing.  This girl is as much mine as my skateboard.  There’s no choice.  Where she goes in time I follow along blindly, but the space isn’t always the same.Some say this makes me too weird and “insane.” It’s not.  What’s weird and insane is the PTSD i suffer every time they try to rid me of her (oh wait, this is just the prelude, shit…. time for me to skate ‘crete or die….)PAGE 1[lone jackl]This morning I woke up and you weren’t there.

Guy saw you eating ice cream in that crowd i’m sure. oh you’re a big man with your big metal bat, but you were eating ice cream at the smoke shop too. fuck you.anyway, Star Shimmer Tale of the other Side of Defeat, was written in a Copenhagen Mental Institution. They were really nice to me. Not at first, but as I calmed down a bit, they were pretty damn chill. Thank God they packed up the sausage factory, and helped me become one again. Best med and food rx by far. Plus we could smoke whenever the fuck we wanted, with each other, and with our fellow guardians.this story flew out of my fingers like blood on fire. she was with me for sure. lg. the fire in me. here’s the cover girl, i scanned both sides at 1200dpi, so it might take a sec… now to the transcription…..</span><br />

<span>the spokanimals journey is no small story. the essay that fit into 3 pages could easily expand into 20,000. there is so much detail and stuff that i just let it leak out a little at a time as it rolls to the top of my brain.i still can’t tell if swallowing my own lung butter is a good thing. for one, i want to get the evil out of me; however, could i get the energy out of the evil and turn it into something good?the world ended at the end of spokanimals in 2004, because i fucking won. i survived. but the key to my survival was quite ironic. i like scary movies. my dad brought me up on them, but i don’t like scary reality. though i also have an open heart. the open heart is what gets me in trouble because it opens one up to demon posession. being nice to everything isnt always the key to survival (), but it was this time. “i won” yay “nothing”when i say nothing i mean the world ended at the end of the spokanimals walk in 2004. i won because i allowed myself to be posessed by Bob (left </span><br />

<span>Copenhagen, DK – Adventure for a Seattle patient</span><br />
<span>I’ve ventured to Copenhagen, Denmark twice: once in 2015 and again in 2016. Both times i was flooded with adventure. People ask me why i went back, and not somewhere else. Probably because it feels like a home away from home, and I’ve never really toured Europe.  Not to mention skateboarding is a passion of mine, and their cities are currently booming with new parks. So when I go there, I get a taste of the new with the old. It feels like home, Seattle, but with a richer taste of history. Castles that burned down in the 16th century are still standing today. Much like the Great Seattle Fire, but that was just 127 or so years ago.Following is a short photo journal. The journal part is a bit wacky, like a lot of the blog posts on this site. Like most Seattleites, I’m kinda a wacky person, so when stress and high adventure inundate my brain, I deal with it differently than normal people. Normal people in the United States grab anger and their fists, or a gun… whereas, I grab my pen, a mu</span><br />

<span>FAST FORWARD 7 YEARS OF FUCKSTICKS When he was little his dad stored some oil or some shit beneath the yard, and capped it with a pipe to the surface level to let in regularly circulated air.  One day he saw it dripping black like blood into a puddle of oil in the dirt. He wondered what it tasted like. Evil has followed him around ever since… just for shits and giggles. She was in a similar way. He remembers the first time he saw her. He was climbing up dark stairs to his bedroom. The hall at the top was pitch black. And all he could see was her perfect face atop a yellow puffy coat. “Another one bites the dust” ran through his head. It reminded him of her. Climbing the stairs in her yellow puffy coat, on her hands and knees, with her tongue hanging out of her mouth in a sexy way. It was the first time he ever thought of girls that way.

<span>The Abstinent Marriage</span><br />
<span>Where do you start? Where’s the court?
It can take awhile
I’ve waited years before
You can’t force a flower to bloom
It has to want to
Force becomes impending doom
And a no-brainer loom over your guilty headThrow a rock on it
And take a breather
Decade or two does a body good
When you love yourself
Shit don’t matterBut your matter matters
In waives of cell driven promises at a tear level
Pick a trinket and cry on it for awhile
Tears are very good at forming new dreams
New dreams that grow
The echo of your thoughts get heard around the world
Every cell of earths black core becomes your corpsCherry swirl beach bomb bingo promCheck it
I was going out with this girl once
A super ego I’d never witnessed before
Passed up the bomb prom for witches and moms
Because I was askedIt was a gas
Hottest girl I’d seen since the early years
Only on par with the one I also already loved
Asked my ass to go“sorry, I have a girl already, but i will ask my dear sweet swedish princess anyway”
“yeah dude, it</span><br />

<span>When I was in Fairfax mental institution in 2004 I saw the most striking girl. Around 5’5, green eyes, thin frame, sandy blonde, small chest, about 23 years old, and wearing a lime green prom dress. She walked in from admittance (probably just attempted suicide), and looked weary of everyone in the place. She sat by me and said, “I guess I’ll just sit by you ok?” Her voice was high pitched yet velvet-toned. There wasn’t much of any dialog between us because I was too shy. All I said was “ok.” We just sat there, content with each other’s presence.The next day she was gone, which was unusual because people don’t usually leave those places the day after they’re admitted. Maybe she was an angel, got transferred, or succeeded in her suicide. I chose to think she was an angel, and have spent many a mania looking for her, Light Girl.When manic, I don’t hear voices, I absorb thoughts.

These guys took a run down sketchy Chinese Karaoke Restaurant, and turned it into a 24 Hour diner for all ages on one side, and a Bar with Awesome karaoke on the other side. I had the Little Dipper, but promise to get the Steak and Prawns next time.</span><br />

<span>ATS Indoor – Fremont Updates</span><br />
<span>When ATS first opened, the old guys griped about there not being a mini in the layout. Now there is! Winter shred sessions are a go!The funny story is I was one of those old guys, but could not resist going to ATS, despite the fact there was only street skating to be had. There aren’t a lot of dry, lit places in Seattle during the Winter months… let alone warm. Anyway, after hitting mini-less ATS for a while, and moving right down the street from Roxhill skatepark last Summer, I like the street more than the mini, and don’t care so much anymore.</span><br />

<span>Nearly everywhere in Seattle there’s a great view of Mt. Rainier towering over the southern horizon. And every time you fly into or out of Seattle, you get a breath taking birds eye view of it. Here are a couple shots I took from a recent flight.  An even better view, if you’re into snow sports, is the view from Crystal Mountain Ski Resort, which is butted up pretty much right next to the volcano.  Sometimes it’s hard to catch it on a sunny day though.</span><br />

<span>Skate – 365 – revisited</span><br />
<span>In Fall of 2011 I made a resolution to skate everyday for 365 days.  It was mostly for health reasons, physically and mentally, but I also just wanted to be a better ripper.  Anyway, I succeeded. Here’s a graph of the parks I visited.When I was done, I took a couple months off.  A little burned out.  After a while off though, I felt like a sloth, and decided to get active again.  My doctor said I needed to do something a little more vigorous, so I started alternating between skateboarding and going to the gym over the days.  At first I just did the elliptical for a half hour at the gym.  I found that it was great cross training for skating.  As I built up my legs at the gym, they got a lot more steady on the board.  Eventually, I upped my time at the gym to an hour, where I’d lift weights for a half hour, then do the elliptical for a half hour.  And I got to be more comfortable on my board than ever.After a while of this routine, my weight plateau’d; even though I was exercising every</span><br />

<span>Melvins played the Showbox last night for their “Hold it In” tour.It was Buzz, Dale, and Butthole Surfers bassist JD Pinkus. Power trio. They lit the place up. Unfortunately no encore, but killer set. They did the Butthole Surfers tune Moving to Florida with Buzz singing. So good.

<span>EXTREME PENCIL FIGHTING RULES (Official WXPFL Blog):

Two challengers face off, each armed with a regulation wooden pencil taken from a factory-sealed pack.The only recognized regulation competition pencil is the Dixon/Ticonderoga #2 yellow – graphite core, cedar shaft, latex eraser with aluminum stay.The pencil may not be sharpened or altered in any way prior to initial combat.A Pink Pearl Eraser flip determines which fighter strikes first.The loser of the eraser flip becomes the “Defender” and holds his or her pencil between both hands in a horizontal position.The winner of the eraser flip becomes the “Striker”, holding their pencil vertically and bringing the pencil down in a strike across the opponent’s pencil with full force, attempting to break it in two.If the Defender’s pencil does not break from the Striker’s attempt, then it becomes the Defender’s turn to strike.
This repeats until one player’s pencil breaks in two and cannot continue.If a pencil is cracked, but not fully br</span><br />

<span>Saw Mark Lanegan at The Showbox Market.  The crowd was pretty thin, because he opened for Nick Cave the night before, and that was totally fine by me.  The less annoying, drunk strangers the better.The whole set was acoustic, with no drums.  Pretty sick.

<span>Seattle Pride Parade 2014</span><br />
<span>Today Seattle had its 40th annual Pride Parade.  I had no idea it was that old.  And I’m a little embarrassed to say, as a native only a year older than this parade, I’ve never been to one.  Or maybe I have, but just don’t remember it.  I’ll remember this one though.  It was amazing.  All 4 hours of it (longest parade in the world maybe?).When I got off the bus on 3rd and Virginia, I had no idea where a good place to watch the parade from would be.  I found this spot on a whim.  Lucky for me, it was right in front of these lovely Emcee Queens.  They were very informative and damn hilarious.George Takei showed up So did Ernie and BertMacklemore was there too, there’s a video clip of him below. For now, here’s a giant balloon octopus.Even the Space Needle raised the Pride flag.  Because Seattle rules.  In Seattle, you can be who you want, and it’s cool.  </span><br />

<span>Jefferson park is super fun for street and bowl riders alike. Plus, it has lights till 11:30pm. And a great playground for non-skating kids.Here’s a nice pano of the park. Could be the best view in the city.Here’s ultra-shredder Payton ripping the bowl.This is the new sculpture on the North end of the park, that’s built to skate.</span><br />

<span>Lock and Keel</span><br />
<span>In the heart of Ballard Avenue lies the Lock and Keel.  I’ve been hanging out here quite a bit since 2011.  Very chill place.If you like boats and all things that float, you’ll love the decor.  Especially the outboard motors for pool table lights.If you do play pool, this is the place to do it.  The tables are only 50 cents, and there are chalk boards for putting your name in a play-the-winner queue, so you don’t have to be like, “hey, my quarters were sitting there first!”  I think they still do free pool Thursdays too.It gets pretty packed with kids in their early 20s on Friday and Saturday night, but not as bad as Kings Hardware.  There’s still an older crowd too, to balance things out.Food is pretty grubbin.  Especially since they smoke their own meat.  And I haven’t tried it, but I guess the chili mac is the bomb.I think my favorite thing about this place is they’re very straight-edge friendly.  Once I got kicked out of another bar for just playing pool, and not ordering drinks. </span><br />

<span>Beth’s Cafe</span><br />
<span>What do night owls do after a busy night of bar hoppin’ in Seattle?  They keep the party goin’ at Beth’s Cafe!  That’s right, all hail the most righteous 24 hour diner in Seattle, just across the Aurora 7-11 by Greenlake.They have a lot of diner food, but I typically go for breakfast, as it’s served 24 hours a day.  Breakfast plates come with bottomless hash browns. Other than that, their monster omelettes, shakes, burgers, french dips, and bacon are to die for.You like coffee and water?  They don’t let your cups go less than half full.  It amazes me.  At 2 AM on a weekend night they are slammed.  Sometimes you have to wait up to 45 minutes for a table (pro-tip, you can just sit at the counter if you’re alone).  Yet, they manage to have plenty of time too keep everyone’s coffee and water full.And for the artist in you, they’ll provide paper and crayons, then proudly display your work on the wall.  Sometimes they have drawing contests too.  I once got a free shake for winning 2nd place</span><br />

<span>It’s tough being a kid and underage when all your favorite bands play in bars.  Fortunately, Seattle had some good all ages hardcore shows back in the day.  Like this Fugazi show at Washington Hall back in 1989.  Where are the all ages shows today?  Check the Stranger All Ages section. I see Seaweed is playing the Vera Project on May 22nd. </span><br />

<span>Greenlake Skatepark</span><br />
<span>I haven’t been to this park in almost a year. I hit it a lot when I was doing the “skate every day for a year” challenge, but haven’t really been back since. Probably because I live in West Seattle, and there’s really no need than to go to Delridge, in my own back yard.Anyway, I haven’t skated with my buddy Clint in a long time either, and he suggested we shred Greenlake, so I gave it a go.It’s a kickin park, with a street area, flow bowl, and pool-style bowl with a ring of blue tiles (Big Blue, some folks call it).  I had all my old lines back.  It was fun.Greenlake is just a nice, refreshing place to kick it in general.  What’s really cool about this skate park, is kids that skate can drag their whole families, because there’s so much other stuff to do, for the non-skaters in the family: runners, walkers, roller-gapers, wrong-boards, tennis players, bikers, soccer players, softball players, kickball players, cross country runners, etc.. </span><br />

<span>Crack Sabbath – Darrells</span><br />
<span>Seattle’s own Crack Sabbath played two sets at Darrells Tavern in Shoreline last night. All-star cast  Skerik, Ron Weinstein, Keith Lowe, Mike Stone, and Brad Mowen brought it, big time.  Probably my favorite set of theirs ever. It was an epic 3 hours of earth shattering hardcore jazz. Don’t miss these guys next time they play.  You won’t be disappointed.Download .zip of all 25 tracks (MP3s) here.  </span><br />

<span>Cinco De Margo</span><br />
<span>Today, May 4th 2014, Marginal Way Skatepark held its annual Cinco Del Margo celebration. There were tacos, raffle, beer, shredders, more shredders, bands, and … A NEW SECTION OF THE PARK! There was a really good turnout, and I’m sure a good amount of money was raised, that will go towards finally finishing the park after 10 years of blood, sweat, crete and beer.
I have footage of the Fakies set, and will post that here as well soon. </span><br />

<span>Seattle Photos</span><br />
<span>I don’t know what it is ,something in the water maybe, but a lot of my friends out here LOVE to take pictures. Not just point and shoot with their phones though. Nice pictures. Pictures not only worth a 1000 words, but worth 1000s of dollars (to produce).  Their cameras are fancy. These are from my buddy Shawn.  We call him Beer For Breakfast.  He let me use a photo for the background, so I’m giving him credit.Also, he’s going to be taking glamour shots of me shredding the gnar at various Seattle Skate Parks this Summer, so look out for those</span><br />

<span>Downtown Shopping</span><br />
<span>I went shopping downtown with my daughter last Saturday. She got a 4.0, so I took her on a little spree for her hard work. She always loves checking out the crazy cool unique shoes at John Fluevog’s.  They’re super expensive though ($300 there is cheap). Once I offered to get her a pair, because she won a bet, but she decided to spend the money on massive amounts of clothing from Forever 21, just down the street, instead.   Blue C Sushi is pretty damn good, but it was her first time having Sushi, and didn’t like it much, so she had teriaki chicken instead. Convention Center always looks way cool. We didn’t go there this time, but sometimes we check out the candy store in westlake center. We thought this was a nice placement of bird shit. Oooh yeah, cupcake royale! And the chocolate store next door had chocolate covered sardines. We always check out Pike Place. “yeah yeah dad, we’ve taken this picture a 100 times.  you look like a tourist” mmmmm candy nick nacks for days what time is i</span><br />

<span>Delridge Skate Park</span><br />
<span>My favorite skate park, aside from Marginal Way. And lucky me, it’s right on Delridge Way in West Seattle (just off the delridge exit), practically in my back yard.There are 3 main parts of the park to skate: the egg bowl, the flow bowl, and the outer track (including China Banks). All very fun and totally shreddable.This is a very large panoramic photograph. Click it to open in its own window.</span><br />
