                    All content is volatile and subject to be removed at any moment. stuffedanimalwar.com is attacked often, on my server anyway, but its resillience is strong; it is easy to kill and restart the service, should it get taken down, or run it on any listening TCP/IP port you choose (~65k port number options).
                    I am constantly researching ways to mitigate attack. If you were to move forward with implementing your own, hosted stuffedanimalwar.com engine, you can always email me at

                <span>I will remove media that has been unaccounted for, but it will take me a little more time to get through all of the rarities that I have sook out, found, purchased, and archived.

                <span>If you would like to talk about hosting the stuffedanimalwar nodejs engine for your own domain, where you could manage your own content and passwords. I will donate the stuffedanimalwar nodejs engine to any artist who is selling their own work online.  And I can also consult on its implementation, and subsequent usage, within reason... this is not my day job. All work on stuffedanimalwar, skatecreteordie, and microservices therein was funded and developed by only me, Jamesa, for the business registered as jaemzware llc in Washington State.
